# ostarian-stories

This project is an attempt at building better knowledge management for the Ostarian Adventures. The raw text logs are being parsed using ANTLR4 and restructured into markdown files that are compatible with the Obsidian note taking tool.

The parser makes an attempt to correct misspellings and link aliases.
