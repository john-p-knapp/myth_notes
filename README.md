# Myth Notes

This project is an attempt at building better knowledge management for a collectionof myths from multiple cultures. The raw text is being parsed using ANTLR4 and restructured into markdown files that are compatible with the Obsidian note taking tool.

The parser makes an attempt to correct misspellings and link aliases.
