THE DEVIL.


CHAPTER I.

DIABOLISM.

Dragon and Devil distinguished--Dragons' wings--War in Heaven--
Expulsion of Serpents--Dissolution of the Dragon--Theological
origin of the Devil--Ideal and actual--Devil Dogma--Debasement
of ideal persons--Transmigration of phantoms.


'We are all nothing other than Wills,' says St. Augustine; and he
adds that of the good and bad angels the nature is the same, the will
different. In harmony with this John Beaumont says, 'A good desire
of mind is a good God.' [1] To which all the mythology of Evil adds,
a bad desire of mind is a Devil. Every personification of an evil
Will looks beyond the outward phenomena of pain, and conceives a
heart that loves evil, a spirit that makes for wickedness. At this
point a new element altogether enters. The physical pain incidentally
represented by the Demon, generalised and organised into a principle
of harmfulness in the Dragon, begins now to pass under the shadow cast
by the ascending light of man's moral nature. Man becomes conscious of
moral and spiritual pains: they may be still imaginatively connected
with bodily agonies, but these drop out of the immediate conception,
disappear into a distant future, and are even replaced by the notion
of an evil symbolised by pleasure.

The fundamental difference between either a Demon or Dragon and a
Devil may be recognised in this: we never find the former voluntarily
bestowing physical pleasure or happiness on man, whereas it is a
chief part of the notion of a Devil that he often confers earthly
favours in order to corrupt the moral nature.

There are, indeed, apparent exceptions to this theorem presented
in the agatho-dragons which have already been considered in our
chapter on the Basilisk; but the reader will observe that there is
no intimation in such myths of any malign ulterior purpose in the
good omens brought by those exceptional monsters, and that they are
really forms of malevolent power whose afflictive intent is supposed
to have been vanquished by the superior might of the heroes or saints
to whose glory they are reluctantly compelled to become tributary.

Undoubtedly the Dragon attended this moral and religious development of
man's inward nature very far, and still occupies, as at once prisoner
and gaoler in the underworld, a subordinate relation to it. In the long
process he has undergone certain transformations, and in particular
his attribute of wings, if not derived from the notion of his struggle
against holier beings, seems to have been largely enhanced thereby. The
exceptional wings given to serpents in Greek art, those, for instance,
which draw Demeter and Persephone in their chariot, are trifling as
compared with the fully-developed wings of our conventional Dragon of
the christian era. Such wings might have been developed occasionally
to denote the flying cloud, the fire-breathing storm, or explain how
some Rahu was enabled to pursue the sun and moon and swallow them
temporarily in the phenomena of eclipse. But these wings grew to
more important dimensions when they were caught up into the Semitic
conception of winged genii and destroying angels, and associated with
an ambitious assault on heaven and its divine or angelic occupants.

'There was war in Heaven,' says the Apocalypse. The traditional
descriptions of this war follow pretty closely, in dramatic details,
other and more ancient struggles which reflect man's encounters with
the hardships of nature. In those encounters man imagined the gods
descending earthward to mingle in the fray; but even where the struggle
mounted highest the scenery is mainly terrestrial and the issues those
of place and power, the dominion of visible Light established above
Darkness, or of a comparatively civilised over a savage race. The
wars between the Devas and Asuras in India, the Devs and Ahuras in
Persia, Buddha and the Nagas in Ceylon, Garura and the Serpent-men
in the north of India, gods and Frost-giants in Scandinavia, still
concern man's relation to the fruits of the earth, to heat and frost,
to darkness or storm and sunshine.

But some of these at length find versions which reveal their tendency
towards spiritualisation. The differences presented by one of these
legends which has survived among us in nearly its ancient form from
the same which remains in a partly mystical form will illustrate
the transitional phase. Thus, Garura expelling the serpents from
his realm in India is not a saintly legend; this exterminator of
serpents is said to have compelled the reptile race to send him one
of their number daily that he might eat it, and the rationalised
tradition interprets this as the prince's cannibalism. The expulsion
of Nagas or serpents from Ceylon by Buddha, in order that he might
consecrate that island to the holy law, marks the pious accentuation
of the fable. The expulsion of snakes from Ireland by St. Patrick
is a legend conceived in the spirit of the curse pronounced upon the
serpent in Eden, but in this case the modern myth is the more primitive
morally, and more nearly represents the exploit of Garura. St. Patrick
expels the snakes that he may make Ireland a paradise physically,
and establish his reputation as an apostle by fulfilling the signs
of one named by Christ; [2] and in this particular it slightly rises
above the Hindu story. In the case of the serpent cursed in Eden a
further moralisation of the conflict is shown. The serpent is not
present in Eden, as in the realms of Garura and St. Patrick, for
purposes of physical devastation or pain, but to bestow a pleasure
on man with a view to success in a further issue between himself and
the deity. Yet in this Eden myth the ancient combat is not yet fairly
spiritualised; for the issue still relates, as in that between the
Devas and Asuras, to the possession of a magical fruit which by no
means confers sanctity. In the apocalyptic legend of the war in heaven,
[3] the legend has become fairly spiritualised. The issue is no longer
terrestrial, it is no longer for mere power; the Dragon is arrayed
against the woman and child, and against the spiritual 'salvation'
of mankind, of whom he is 'accuser' and 'deceiver.'

Surely nobody could be 'deceived' by 'a great fiery-red Dragon, having
seven heads and ten horns'! In this vision the Dragon is pressed as far
as the form can go in the symbolisation of evil. To devour the child is
its legitimate work, but as 'accuser of the brethren before God day and
night' the monstrous shape were surely out of place by any mythologic
analogy; and one could hardly imagine such a physiognomy capable of
deceiving 'the whole world.' It is not wonderful, therefore, that the
Dragon's presence in heaven is only mentioned in connection with his
fall from it. It is significant that the wings are lost in this fall;
for while his 'angelic' relationship suggests the previous wings,
the woman is able to escape the fallen monster by the two wings given
her. [4] Wingless now, 'the old serpent' once more, the monster's
shape has no adaptation to the moral and religious struggle which
is to ensue. For his shape is a method, and it means the perfection
of brute force. That, indeed, also remains in the sequel of this
magnificent myth. As in the legend of the Hydra two heads spring up
in place of that which falls, so in this Christian legend out of the
overthrown monster, henceforth himself concealed, two arise from his
inspiration,--the seven-headed, ten-horned Beast who continues the work
of wrath and pain; but also a lamb-like Beast, with only two horns
(far less terrible), and able to deceive by his miracles, for he is
even able to call down fire from heaven. The ancient Serpent-dragon,
the expression of natural pain, thus goes to pieces. His older part
remains to work mischief and hurt; and the cry is uttered, 'Be merry,
ye heavens, and ye that tabernacle in them: woe to the earth and the
sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath because
he knows that he has a short time.' [5] But there is a lamb-like part
of him too, and his relation to the Dragon is only known by his voice.

This subtle adaptation of the symbol of external pain to the
representation of the moral struggle, wherein the hostile power
may assume deceptive forms of beauty and pleasure, is only one
impressive illustration of the transfer of human conceptions of evil
from outward to inward nature. The transition is from a malevolent,
fatal, principle of harmfulness to the body to a malevolent, fatal,
principle of evil to the conscience. The Demon was natural; the
Dragon was both physical and metaphysical; the Devil was and is
theological. In the primitive Zoroastrian theology, where the Devil
first appears in clear definition, he is the opponent of the Good
Mind, and the combat between the two, Ormuzd and Ahriman, is the
spiritualisation of the combat between Light and Darkness, Pain and
Happiness, in the external world. As these visible antagonists were
supposed to be exactly balanced against each other, so are their
spiritual correlatives. The Two Minds are described as Twins.

'Those old Spirits, who are twins, made known what is good and what is
evil in thoughts, words, and deeds. Those who are good distinguished
between the two; not so those who are evil-doers.

'When these two Spirits came together they made first life and death,
so that there should be at last the most wretched life for the bad,
but for the good blessedness.

'Of these two Spirits the evil one chose the worst deeds; the
kind Spirit, he whose garment is the immovable sky, chose what is
right.' [6]

This metaphysical theory follows closely the primitive scientific
observations on which it is based; it is the cold of the cold,
the gloom of the darkness, the sting of death, translated into some
order for the intellect which, having passed through the Dragon, we
find appearing in this Persian Devil; and against his blackness the
glory of the personality from whom all good things proceed shines
out in a splendour no longer marred by association with the evil
side of nature. Ormuzd is celebrated as 'father of the pure world,'
who sustains 'the earth and the clouds that they do not fall,' and
'has made the kindly light and the darkness, the kindly sleep and the
awaking;' [7] at every step being suggested the father of the impure
world, the unkindly light, darkness or sleep.

The ecstasy which attended man's first vision of an ideal life defied
the contradictory facts of outward and inward nature. So soon as he
had beheld a purer image of himself rising above his own animalism,
he must not only regard that animalism as an instigation of a devil,
but also the like of it in nature; and this conception will proceed
pari passu with the creation of pure deities in the image of that
higher self. There was as yet no philosophy demanding unity in the
Cosmos, or forbidding man to hold as accursed so much of nature as
did not obviously accord with his ideals.

Mr. Edward B. Tylor has traced the growth of Animism from man's
shadow and his breathing; Sir John Lubbock has traced the influence of
dreams in forming around him a ghostly world; Mr. Herbert Spencer has
given an analysis of the probable processes by which this invisible
environment was shaped for the mental conception in accordance
with family and social conditions. But it is necessary that we
should here recognise the shadow that walked by the moral nature,
the breathings of religious aspiration, and the dreams which visited
a man whose moral sense was so generally at variance with his animal
desires. The code established for the common good, while necessarily
having a relation to every individual conscience, is a restriction
upon individual liberty. The conflict between selfishness and duty is
thus inaugurated; it continues in the struggle between the 'law in the
members and the law in the spirit,' which led Paul to beat his body
(hypopiaxomai) to keep it in subjection; it passes from the Latin
poet to the Englishman, who turns his experience to a rune--


        I see the right, and I approve it too;
        Condemn the wrong, and yet the wrong pursue.


As the light which cast it was intense, even so intense was the shadow
it cast beneath all it could not penetrate. Passionate as was the
saintliest man's love of good, even so passionate was his spiritual
enemy's love of evil. High as was the azure vault that mingled with his
dreams of purity, so deep was the abyss beneath his lower nature. The
superficial equalities of phenomena, painful and pleasurable, to his
animal nature had cast the mould into which his theories of the inward
and the moral phenomena must be cast; and thus man--in an august
moment--surrendered himself to the dreadful conception of a supreme
Principle of Wickedness: wherever good was there stood its adversary;
wherever truth, there its denier; no light shone without the dark
presence that would quench it; innocence had its official accuser,
virtue its accomplished tempter, peace its breaker, faith its disturber
and mocker. Nay, to this impersonation was added the last feature
of fiendishness, a nature which found its supreme satisfaction in
ultimately torturing human beings for the sins instigated by himself.

It is open to question how far any average of mankind really conceived
this theological dogma. Easy as it is to put into clear verbal
statement; readily as the analogies of nature supply arguments for
and illustrations of a balance between moral light and darkness, love
and hatred; yet is man limited in subjective conceptions to his own
possibilities, and it may almost be said that to genuinely believe in
an absolute Fiend a man would have to be potentially one himself. But
any human being, animated by causeless and purposeless desire to
inflict pain on others, would be universally regarded as insane,
much more one who would without motive corrupt as well as afflict.

Even theological statements of the personality of Evil, and what that
implies, are rare. The following is brave enough to be put on record,
apart from its suggestiveness.

'It cannot be denied that as there is an inspiration of holy love,
so is there an inspiration of hatred, or frantic pleasure, with which
men surrender themselves to the impulses of destructiveness; and when
the popular language speaks of possessions of Satan, of incarnate
devils, there lies at the bottom of this the grave truth that men,
by continued sinning, may pass the ordinary limit between human and
diabolic depravity, and lay open in themselves a deep abyss of hatred
which, without any mixture of self-interest, finds its gratification
in devastation and woe.' [8]

On this it may be said that the popular commentary on cases of the
kind is contained in the very phrase alluded to, 'possession,'--the
implication being that such disinterested depravity is nowise possible
within the range of simple human experience,--and, in modern times,
'possessions' are treated in asylums. Morbid conditions, however, are
of such varied degrees that it is probable many have imagined a Being
in whom their worst impulses are unrestrained, and thus there have
been sufficient popular approximations to an imaginative conception
of a Devil to enable the theological dogma, which few can analyse,
to survive.

It must not be supposed, however, that the moral and spiritual ideals,
to which allusion has just been made, are normally represented in the
various Devils which we have to consider. It is the characteristic of
personifications, whether celestial or infernal, to supersede gradually
the ideas out of which they spring. As in the fable of Agni, who is
said to have devoured his parents when he was born, a metaphor of fire
consuming the two sticks which produce it, religious history shows both
deities and devils, by the flame of personal devotion or hatred they
engender, burning up the ideas that originate them. When instead of
unconscious forces and inanimate laws working to results called good
and evil, men see great personal Wills engaged in personal conflict,
the universe becomes a government of combat; the stars of heaven, the
angels and the imps, men and women, the very plants and animals, are
caught up in the battle, to be marshalled on one side or the other;
and in the military spirit and fury of the struggle the spiritual
ideals become as insignificant beneath the phantom-hosts they evoked
as the violets and daisies which an army tramples in its march. There
is little difference at last between the moral characteristics of
the respective armies of Ormuzd and Ahriman, Michael and Satan; their
strategy and ferocity are the same. [9] Wherever the conception is that
of a universe divided into hostile camps, the appropriate passions are
kindled, and in the thick of the field, where Cruelty and Gentleness
met, is seen at last a horned Beast confronted by a horned Lamb. [10]
On both sides is exaltation of the horn.

We need only look at the outcome of the gentle and lowly Jesus through
the exigencies of the church militant to see how potent are such
forces. Although lay Christians of ordinary education are accustomed
to rationalise their dogmas as well as they can, and dwell on the
loving and patient characteristics of Jesus, the horns which were
attached to the brow of him who said, 'Love your enemies' by ages of
Christian warfare remain still in the Christ of Theology, and they
are still depended on to overawe the 'sinner.' In an orthodox family
with which I have had some acquaintance, a little boy, who had used
naughty expressions of resentment towards a playmate was admonished
that he should be more like Christ, 'who never did any harm to his
enemies.' 'No,' answered the wrathful child, 'but he's a-going to.'

As in Demonology we trace the struggles of man with external
obstructions, and the phantasms in which these were reflected until
they were understood or surmounted, we have now to consider the forms
which report human progression on a higher plane,--that of social,
moral, and religious evolution. Creations of a crude Theology, in its
attempt to interpret the moral sentiment, the Devils to which we now
turn our attention have multiplied as the various interests of mankind
have come into relations with their conscience. Every degree of ascent
of the moral nature has been marked by innumerable new shadows cast
athwart the mind and the life of man. Every new heaven of ideas
is followed by a new earth, but ere this conformity of things to
thoughts can take place struggles must come and the old demons will
be recalled for new service. As time goes on things new grow old;
the fresh issues pass away, their battlefields grow cold; then the
brood of superstition must flit away to the next field where carrion is
found. Foul and repulsive as are these vultures of the mind--organisms
of moral sewage--every one of them is a witness to the victories of
mankind over the evils they shadow, and to the steady advance of a
new earth which supplies them no habitat but the archaeologist's page.







CHAPTER II.

THE SECOND BEST.

Respect for the Devil--Primitive atheism--Idealisation--Birth of
new gods--New gods diabolised--Compromise between new gods and
old--Foreign deities degraded--Their utilisation.


A lady residing in Hampshire, England, recently said to a friend of
the present writer, both being mothers, 'Do you make your children
bow their heads whenever they mention the Devil's name? I do,' she
added solemnly,--'I think it's safer.'

This instance of reverence for the Devil's name, occurring in a
respectable English family, may excite a smile; but if my reader has
perused the third and fourth chapters (Part I.) of this work, in which
it was necessary to state certain facts and principles which underlie
the phenomena of degradation in both Demonology and Devil-lore, he will
already know the high significance of nearly all the names which have
invested the personifications of evil; and he will not be surprised to
find their original sanctity, though lowered, sometimes, surviving in
such imaginary forms after the battles in which they were vanquished
have passed out of all contemporary interest. If, for example, instead
of the Devil, whose name is uttered with respect in the Hampshire
household, any theological bogey of our own time were there mentioned,
such as 'Atheist,' it might hardly receive such considerate treatment.

The two chapters just referred to anticipate much that should be
considered at this point of our inquiry. It is only necessary here
to supplement them with a brief statement, and to some extent a
recapitulation, of the processes by which degraded deities are
preserved to continue through a structural development and fulfil
a necessary part in every theological scheme which includes the
conception of an eternal difference between good and evil.

Every personification when it first appears expresses a higher
and larger view. When deities representing the physical needs of
mankind have failed, as they necessarily must, to meet those needs,
atheism follows, though it cannot for a long time find philosophical
expression. It is an atheism ad hoc, so to say, and works by
degrading particular gods instead of by constructing antitheistic
theories. Successive dynasties of deities arise and flourish in this
way, each representing a less arbitrary relation to nature,--peril
lying in that direction,--and a higher moral and spiritual ideal,
this being the stronghold of deities. It is obvious that it is far
easier to maintain the theory that prayers are heard and answered
by a deity if those prayers are limited to spiritual requests, than
when they are petitions for outward benefits. By giving over the
cruel and remorseless forces of nature to the Devil,--i.e.,  to this
or that personification of them who, as gods, had been appealed to
in vain to soften such forces,--the more spiritual god that follows
gains in security as well as beauty what he surrenders of empire and
omnipotence. This law, illustrated in our chapter on Fate, operates
with tremendous effect upon the conditions under which the old combat
is spiritualised.

An eloquent preacher has said:--'Hawthorne's fine fancy of the youth
who ascribed heroic qualities to the stone face on the brow of a
cliff, thus converting the rocky profile into a man, and, by dint of
meditating on it with admiring awe, actually transferred to himself
the moral elements he worshipped, has been made fact a thousand times,
is made fact every day, by earnest spirits who by faithful longing
turn their visions into verities, and obtain live answers to their
petitions to shadows.' [11]

However imaginary may be the benedictions so derived by the worshipper
from his image, they are most real as they redound to the glory
and power of the image. The crudest personification, gathering up
the sanctities of generations, associated with the holiest hopes,
the best emotions, the profoundest aspirations of human nature,
may be at length so identified with these sentiments that they all
seem absolutely dependent upon the image they invest. Every criticism
of such a personification then seems like a blow aimed at the moral
laws. If educated men are still found in Christendom discussing whether
morality can survive the overthrow of such personifications, and
whether life were worth living without them, we may readily understand
how in times when the social, ethical, and psychological sciences
did not exist at all, all that human beings valued seemed destined
to stand or fall with the Person supposed to be their only keystone.

But no Personage, however highly throned, can arrest the sun and
moon, or the mind and life of humanity. With every advance in
physical or social conditions moral elements must be influenced;
every new combination involves a recast of experiences, and presently
of convictions. Henceforth the deified image can only remain as a
tyrant over the heart and brain which have created it,--


                          Creatura a un tempo
            E tiranno de l'uom, da cui soltanto
            Ebbe nomi ed aspetti e regno e altari. [12]


This personification, thus 'at once man's creature and his tyrant,' is
objectively a name. But as it has been invested with all that has been
most sacred, it is inevitable that any name raised against it shall be
equally associated with all that has been considered basest. This also
must be personified, for the same reason that the good is personified;
and as names are chiefly hereditary, it pretty generally happens that
the title of some fallen and discredited deity is advanced to receive
the new anathema. But what else does he receive? The new ideas; the
growing ideals and the fresh enthusiasms are associated with some
fantastic shape with anathematised name evoked from the past, and
thus a portentous situation is reached. The worshippers of the new
image will not accept the bad name and its base associations; they
even grow strong enough to claim the name and altars of the existing
order, and give battle for the same. Then occurs the demoralisation,
literally speaking, of the older theology. The personification reduced
to struggle for its existence can no longer lay emphasis upon the
moral principles it had embodied, these being equally possessed by
their opponents; nay, its partisans manage to associate with their
holy Name so much bigotry and cruelty that the innovators are at length
willing to resign it. The personal loyalty, which is found to continue
after loyalty to principles has ceased, proceeds to degrade the virtues
once reverenced when they are found connected with a rival name. 'He
casteth out devils through Beelzebub' is a very ancient cry. It was
heard again when Tertullian said, 'Satan is God's ape.' St. Augustine
recognises the similarity between the observances of Christians and
pagans as proving the subtle imitativeness of the Devil; the phenomena
referred to are considered elsewhere, but, in the present connection,
it may be remarked that this readiness to regard the same sacrament
as supremely holy or supremely diabolical as it is celebrated in
honour of one name or another, accords closely with the reverence
or detestation of things more important than sacraments, as they
are, or are not, consecrated by what each theology deems official
sanction. When sects talk of 'mere morality' we may recognise in
the phrase the last faint war-cry of a god from whom the spiritual
ideal has passed away, and whose name even can survive only through
alliance with the new claimant of his altars. While the new gods were
being called devils the old ones were becoming such.

The victory of the new ideal turns the old one to an idol. But we are
considering a phase of the world when superstition must invest the
new as well as the old, though in a weaker degree. A new religious
system prevails chiefly through its moral superiority to that it
supersedes; but when it has succeeded to the temples and altars
consecrated to previous divinities, when the ardour of battle is
over and conciliation becomes a policy as well as a virtue, the old
idol is likely to be treated with respect, and may not impossibly be
brought into friendly relation with its victorious adversary. He may
take his place as 'the second best,' to borrow Goethe's phrase, and be
assigned some function in the new theologic regime. Thus, behind the
simplicity of the Hampshire lady instructing her children to bow at
mention of the Devil's name, stretch the centuries in which Christian
divines have as warmly defended the existence of Satan as that of God
himself. With sufficient reason: that infernal being, some time God's
'ape' and rival, was necessarily developed into his present position
and office of agent and executioner under the divine government. He
is the great Second Best; and it is a strange hallucination to fancy
that, in an age of peaceful inquiry, any divine personification can
be maintained without this patient Goat, who bears blame for all
the faults of nature, and who relieves divine Love from the odium
of supplying that fear which is the mother of devotion,--at least in
the many millions of illogical eyes into which priests can still look
without laughing.

Such, in brief outline, has been the interaction of moral and
intellectual forces operating within the limits of established systems,
and of the nations governed by them. But there are added factors,
intensifying the forces on each side, when alien are brought into
rivalry and collision with national deities. In such a contest, besides
the moral and spiritual sentiments and the household sanctities, which
have become intertwined with the internal deities, national pride is
also enlisted, and patriotism. But on the other side is enlisted the
charm of novelty, and the consciousness of fault and failure in the
home system. Every system imported to a foreign land leaves behind
its practical shortcomings, puts its best foot forward--namely, its
theoretical foot--and has the advantage of suggesting a way of escape
from the existing routine which has become oppressive. Napoleon I. said
that no people profoundly attached to the institutions of their country
can be conquered; but what people are attached to the priestly system
over them? That internal dissatisfaction which, in secular government,
gives welcome to a dashing Corsican or a Prince of Orange, has been
the means of introducing many an alien religion, and giving to many a
prophet the honour denied him in his own country. Buddha was a Hindu,
but the triumph of his religion is not in India; Zoroaster was a
Persian, but there are no Parsees in Persia; Christianity is hardly
a colonist even in the native land of Christ.

These combinations and changes were not effected without fierce
controversies, ferocious wars, or persecutions, and the formation
of many devils. Nothing is more normal in ancient systems than the
belief that the gods of other nations are devils. The slaughter of
the priests of Baal corresponds with the development of their god
into Beelzebub. In proportion to the success of Olaf in crushing
the worshippers of [[Odin]], their deity is steadily transformed to a
diabolical Wild Huntsman. But here also the forces of partial recovery,
which we have seen operating in the outcome of internal reform,
manifest themselves; the vanquished, and for a time outlawed deity, is,
in many cases, subsequently conciliated and given an inferior, and,
though hateful, a useful office in the new order. Sometimes, indeed,
as in the case of the Hindu destroyer Siva, it is found necessary
to assign a god, anathematised beyond all power of whitewash, to an
equal rank with the most virtuous deity. Political forces and the
exigencies of propagandism work many marvels of this kind, which will
meet us in the further stages of our investigation.

Every superseded god who survives in subordination to another is pretty
sure to be developed into a Devil. Euphemism may tell pleasant fables
about him, priestcraft may find it useful to perpetuate belief in his
existence, but all the evils of the universe, which it is inconvenient
to explain, are gradually laid upon him, and sink him down, until
nothing is left of his former glory but a shining name.







CHAPTER III.

AHRIMAN: THE DIVINE DEVIL.

Mr. Irving's impersonation of Superstition--Revolution against
pious privilege--Doctrine of 'merits'--Saintly immorality in
India--A Pantheon turned Inferno--Zendavesta on Good and Evil--
Parsi Mythology--The Combat of Ahriman with Ormuzd--Optimism--
Parsi Eschatology--Final Restoration of Ahriman.


Any one who has witnessed Mr. Henry Irving's scholarly and masterly
impersonation of the character of Louis XI. has had an opportunity of
recognising a phase of superstition which happily it were now difficult
to find off the stage. Nothing could exceed the fine realism with
which that artist brought before the spectator the perfected type of a
pretended religion from which all moral features have been eliminated
by such slow processes that the final success is unconsciously reached,
and the horrible result appears unchecked by even any affectation
of actual virtue. We see the king at sound of a bell pausing in his
instructions for a treacherous assassination to mumble his prayers,
and then instantly reverting to the villany over whose prospective
success he gloats. In the secrecy of his chamber no mask falls, for
there is no mask; the face of superstition and vice on which we look
is the real face which the ages of fanaticism have transmitted to him.

Such a face has oftener been that of a nation than that of an
individual, for the healthy forces of life work amid the homes
and hearts of mankind long before their theories are reached and
influenced. Such a face it was against which the moral insurrection
which bears the name of Zoroaster arose, seeing it as physiognomy of
the Evil Mind, naming it Ahriman, and, in the name of the conscience,
aiming at it the blow which is still felt across the centuries.

Ingenious theorists have accounted for the Iranian philosophy of
a universal war between Ormuzd (Ahuramazda) the Good, and Ahriman
(Angromainyus) the Evil, by vast and terrible climatic changes,
involving extremes of heat and cold, of which geologists find traces
about Old Iran, from which a colony of Aryans migrated to New Iran,
or Persia. But although physical conditions of this character may have
supplied many of the metaphors in which the conflict between Good and
Evil is described in the Avesta, there are other characteristics of
that ancient scripture which render it more probable that the early
colonisation of Persia was, like that of New England, the result of a
religious struggle. Some of the gods most adored in India reappear as
execrated demons in the religion of Zoroaster; the Hindu word for god
is the Parsi word for devil. These antagonisms are not merely verbal;
they are accompanied in the Avesta with the most furious denunciations
of theological opponents, whom it is not difficult to identify with
the priests and adherents of the Brahman religion.

The spirit of the early scriptures of India leaves no room for
doubt as to the point at which this revolution began. It was against
pious Privilege. The saintly hierarchy of India were a caste quite
irresponsible to moral laws. The ancient gods, vague names for the
powers of nature, were strictly limited in their dispensations to
those of their priests; [13] and as to these priests the chief
necessities were ample offerings, sacrifices, and fulfilment of
the ceremonial ordinances in which their authority was organised,
these were the performances rewarded by a reciprocal recognition of
authority. To the image of this political regime, theology, always
facile, accommodated the regulations of the gods. The moral law can
only live by being supreme; and as it was not supreme in the Hindu
pantheon, it died out of it. The doctrine of 'merits,' invented by
priests purely for their own power, included nothing meritorious,
humanly considered; the merits consisted of costly sacrifices,
rich offerings to temples, tremendous penances for fictitious sins,
ingeniously devised to aggrandise the penances which disguised power,
and prolonged austerities that might be comfortably commuted by the
wealthy. When this doctrine had obtained general adherence, and was
represented by a terrestrial government corresponding to it, the
gods were necessarily subject to it. That were only to say that the
powers of nature were obedient to the 'merits' of privileged saints;
and from this it is an obvious inference that they are relieved from
moral laws binding on the vulgar.

The legends which represent this phase of priestly dominion are
curiously mixed. It would appear that under the doctrine of 'merits'
the old gods declined. Such appears to be the intimation of the
stories which report the distress of the gods through the power
of human saints. The Rajah Ravana acquired such power that he was
said to have arrested the sun and moon, and so oppressed the gods
that they temporarily transformed themselves to monkeys in order
to destroy him. Though Viswamitra murders a saint, his merits are
such that the gods are in great alarm lest they become his menials;
and the completeness, with which moral considerations are left out
of the struggle on both sides is disclosed in the item that the gods
commissioned a nymph to seduce the saintly murderer, and so reduce a
little the force of his austerities. It will be remembered that the
ancient struggle of the Devas and Asuras was not owing to any moral
differences, but to an alleged unfair distribution of the ambrosia
produced by their joint labours in churning the ocean. The fact that
the gods cheated the demons on that occasion was never supposed to
affect the supremacy they acquired by the treachery; and it could,
therefore, cause no scandal when later legends reported that the demons
were occasionally able to take gods captive by the practice of these
wonderful 'merits' which were so independent of morals. One Asura
is said to have gained such power in this way that he subjugated the
gods, and so punished them that Siva, who had originally endowed that
demon, called into being Scanda, a war-god, to defend the tortured
deities. The most ludicrous part of all is that the gods themselves
were gradually reduced to the necessity of competing like others for
these tremendous powers; thus the Bhagavat Purana states that Brahma
was enabled to create the universe by previously undergoing penance
for sixteen thousand years.

The legends just referred to are puranic, and consequently of much
later date than the revolution traceable in the Iranian religion;
but these later legends are normal growths from vedic roots. These
were the principles of ancient theology, and the foundation of
priestly government. In view of them we need not wonder that Hindu
theology devised no special devil; almost any of its gods might
answer the purposes of one. Nor need we be surprised that it had no
particular hell; any society organised by the sanctions of religion,
but irresponsible to its moral laws, would render it unnecessary to
look far for a hell.

From this cosmological chaos the more intelligent Hindus were of
course liberated; but the degree to which the fearful training had
corrupted the moral tissues of those who had been subjected to it
was revealed in the bald principle of their philosophers, that the
superstition must continue to be imposed on the vulgar, whilst the
learned might turn all the gods into a scientific terminology.

The first clear and truthful eye that touched that system would
transform it from a Heaven to an Inferno. So was it changed under
the eye of Zoroaster. That ancient pantheon which had become a refuge
for all the lies of the known world; whose gods were liars and their
supporters liars; was now turned into a realm of organised disorder, of
systematised wrong; a vast creation of wickedness, at whose centre sat
its creator and inspirer, the immoral god, the divine devil--Ahriman.

It is indeed impossible to ascertain how far the revolt against the old
Brahmanic system was political. It is, of course, highly improbable
that any merely speculative system would excite a revolution; but at
the same time it must be remembered that, in early days, an importance
was generally attached to even abstract opinions such as we still
find among the superstitious who regard an atheistic sentiment as
worse than a theft. However this may have been, the Avesta does
not leave us in any doubt as to the main fact,--namely, that at a
certain time and place man came to a point where he had to confront
antagonism to fundamental moral principles, and that he found the
so-called gods against him. In the establishment of those principles
priests recognised their own disestablishment. What those moral laws
that had become necessary to society were is also made clear. 'We
worship the Pure, the Lord of Purity!' 'We honour the good spirit,
the good kingdom, the good law,--all that is good.' 'Evil doctrine
shall not again destroy the world.' 'Good is the thought, good the
word, good the deed, of the pure Zarathustra.' 'In the beginning
the two heavenly Ones spoke--the Good to the Evil--thus: Our souls,
doctrines, words, works, do not unite together.' These sentences are
from the oldest Gathas of the Avesta.

The following is a very ancient Gatha:--'All your Devas (Hindu 'gods')
are only manifold children of the Evil Mind, and the great One who
worships the Saoma of lies and deceits; besides the treacherous acts
for which you are notorious in the Seven Regions of the earth. You have
invented all the evil that men speak and do, which is indeed pleasant
to the Devas, and is devoid of all goodness, and therefore perishes
before the insight of the truth of the wise. Thus you defraud men of
their good minds and of their immortality by your evil minds--as well
by those of the Devas as through that of the Evil Spirit--through
evil deeds and evil words, whereby the power of liars grows.

'1. Come near, and listen to the wise sayings of the omniscient,
the songs in praise of the Living One, and the prayers of the Good
Spirit, the glorious truths whose origin is seen in the flames.

'2. Listen, therefore, to the Earth spirit--Look at the flames with
reverent mind. Every one, man and woman, is to be distinguished
according to his belief. Ye ancient Powers, watch and be with us!

'3. From the beginning there were two Spirits, each active in
itself. They are the good and the bad in thought, word, and
deed. Choose ye between them: do good, not evil!

'4. And these two Spirits meet and create the first existence,
the earthy, that which is and that which is not, and the last,
the spiritual. The worst existence is for the liars, the best for
the truthful.

'5. Of these two spirits choose ye one, either the lying, the worker
of Evil, or the true holiest spirit. Whoso chooses the first chooses
the hardest fate; whoso the last, honours Ahuramazda in faith and in
truth by his deeds.

'6. Ye cannot serve both of these two. An evil spirit whom we will
destroy surprises those who deliberate, saying, Choose the Evil
Mind! Then do those spirits gather in troops to attack the two lives
of which the prophets prophesy.

'7. And to this earthly life came Armaiti with earthly power to help
the truth, and the good disposition: she, the Eternal, created the
material world, but the Spirit is with thee, O Wise One! the first
of creations in time.

'8. When any evil falls upon the spirit, thou, O Wise One, givest
temporal possessions and a good disposition; but him whose promises
are lies, and not truth, thou punishest.'

Around the hymns of the Avesta gradually grew a theology and a
mythology which were destined to exert a powerful influence on
the world. These are contained in the Bundehesch. [14] Anterior to
all things and all beings was Zeruane-Akrene ('Boundless Time'), so
exalted that he can only be worshipped in silence. From him emanated
two Ferouers, spiritual types, which took form in two beings, Ormuzd
and Ahriman. These were equally pure; but Ahriman became jealous of his
first-born brother, Ormuzd. To punish Ahriman for his evil feeling, the
Supreme Being condemned him to 12,000 years' imprisonment in an empire
of rayless Darkness. During that period must rage the conflict between
Light and Darkness, Good and Evil. As Ormuzd had his pre-existing type
or Ferouer, so by a similar power--much the same as the Platonic Logos
or Word--he created the pure or spiritual world, by means of which the
empire of Ahriman should be overthrown. On the earth (still spiritual)
he raised the exceeding high mountain Albordj, Elburz (snow mountain),
[15] on whose summit he fixed his throne; whence he stretched the
bridge Chinevat, which, passing directly over Duzhak, the abyss of
Ahriman (or hell), reaches to the portal of Gorodman, or heaven. All
this was but a Ferouer world--a prototype of the material world. In
anticipation of its incorporation in a material creation, Ormuzd
(by emanations) created in his own image six Amshaspands, or agents,
of both sexes, to be models of perfection to lower spirits--and to
mankind, when they should be created--and offer up their prayers to
himself. The second series of emanations were the Izeds, benevolent
genii and guardians of the world, twenty-eight in number, of whom the
chief is Mithras, the Mediator. The third series of emanations were the
innumerable Ferouers of things and men--for each must have its soul,
which shall purify them in the day of resurrection. In antagonism to
all these, Ahriman produced an exactly similar host of dark and evil
powers. These Devas rise, rank on rank, to their Arch-Devs--each
of whom is chained to his planet--and their head is Ash-Mogh, the
'two-footed serpent of lies,' who seems to correspond to Mithras,
the divine Mediator.

After a reign of 3000 years Ormuzd entered on the work of realising
his spiritual emanations in a material universe. He formed the sun
as commander-in-chief, the moon as his lieutenant, the planets as
captains of a great host--the stars--who were soldiers in his war
against Ahriman. The dog Sirius he set to watch at the bridge Chinevat
(the Milky Way), lest thereby Ahriman should scale the heavens. Ormuzd
then created earth and water, which Ahriman did not try to prevent,
knowing that darkness was inherent in these. But he struck a blow
when life was produced. This was in form of a Bull, and Ahriman
entered it and it perished; but on its destruction there came out
of its left shoulder the seed of all clean and gentle animals, and,
out of its right shoulder--Man.

Ahriman had matched every creation thus far; but to make man was
beyond his power, and he had no recourse but to destroy him. However,
when the original man was destroyed, there sprang from his body a tree
which bore the first human pair, whom Ahriman, however, corrupted in
the manner elsewhere described.

It is a very notable characteristic of this Iranian theology, that
although the forces of good and evil are co-extensive and formally
balanced, in potency they are not quite equal. The balance of force
is just a little on the side of the Good Spirit. And this advantage
appears in man. Zoroaster said, 'No earthly man with a hundredfold
strength does so much evil as Mithra with heavenly strength does good;'
and this thought reappears in the Parsi belief that the one part
of paradisiac purity, which man retained after his fall, balances
the ninety-nine parts won by Ahriman, and in the end will redeem
him. For this one divine ray preserved enables him to receive and
obey the Avesta, and to climb to heaven by the stairway of three
vast steps--pure thought, pure word, pure deed. The optimistic
essence of the mythology is further shown in the belief that every
destructive effort of Ahriman resulted in a larger benefit than Ormuzd
had created. The Bull (Life) destroyed, man and animal sprang into
being; the man destroyed, man and woman appeared. And so on to the
end. In the last quarter of the 12,000 years for which Ahriman was
condemned, he rises to greater power even than Ormuzd, and finally
he will, by a fiery comet, set the visible universe in conflagration;
but while this scheme is waxing to consummation Ormuzd will send his
holy Prophet Sosioch, who will convert mankind to the true law, [16]
so that when Ahriman's comet consumes the earth he will really be
purifying it. Through the vast stream of melted metals and minerals
the righteous shall pass, and to them it will be as a bath of warm
milk: the wicked in attempting to pass shall be swept into the abyss
of Duzhak; having then suffered three days and nights, they shall be
raised by Ormuzd refined and purified. Duzhak itself shall be purified
by this fire, and last of all Ahriman himself shall ascend to his
original purity and happiness. Then from the ashes of the former
world shall bloom a paradise that shall remain for ever.

In this system it is notable that we find the monster serpent
of vedic mythology, Ahi, transformed into an infernal region,
Duzhak. The dragon, being a type of physical suffering, passes away
in Iranian as in the later Semitic mythology before the new form,
which represents the stings of conscience though it may be beneath
external pleasure. In this respect, therefore, Ahriman fulfils the
definition of a devil already given. In the Avesta he fulfils also
another condition essential to a devil, the love of evil in and for
itself. But in the later theology it will be observed that evil
in Ahriman is not organic. The war being over and its fury past,
the hostile chief is seen not so black as he had been painted;
the belief obtains that he does not actually love darkness and
evil. He was thrust into them as a punishment for his jealousy,
pride, and destructive ambition. And because that dark kingdom was a
punishment--therefore not congenial--it was at length (the danger past)
held to be disciplinary. Growing faith in the real supremacy of Good
discovers the immoral god to be an exaggerated anthropomorphic egoist;
this divine devil is a self-centred potentate who had attempted to
subordinate moral law and human welfare to his personal ascendancy. His
fate having sealed the sentence on all ambitions of that character,
humanity is able to pardon the individual offender, and find a hope
that Ahriman, having learned that no real satisfaction for a divine
nature can be found in mere power detached from rectitude, will join
in the harmony of love and loyalty at last.







CHAPTER IV.

VISWaMITRA: THE THEOCRATIC DEVIL.

Priestcraft and Pessimism--An Aryan Tetzel and his Luther--Brahman
Frogs--Evolution of the sacerdotal Saint--Viswamitra the Accuser
of Virtue--The Tamil Passion-play 'Harischandra'--Ordeal of
Goblins--The Martyr of Truth--Virtue triumphant over ceremonial
'merits'--Harischandra and Job.


Priestcraft in government means pessimism in the creed and despair in
the heart. Under sacerdotal rule in India it seemed paradise enough to
leave the world, and the only hell dreaded was a return to it. 'The
twice-born man,' says Manu, 'who shall without intermission have
passed the time of his studentship, shall ascend after death to the
most exalted of regions, and no more spring to birth again in this
lower world.' Some clause was necessary to keep the twice-born man
from suicide. Buddha invented a plan of suicide-in-life combined with
annihilation of the gods, which was driven out of India because it put
into the minds of the people the philosophy of the schools. Thought
could only be trusted among classes interested to conceal it.

The power and authority of a priesthood can only be maintained on
the doctrine that man is 'saved' by the deeds of a ceremonial law;
any general belief that morality is more acceptable to gods than
ceremonies must be fatal to those occult and fictitious virtues which
hedge about every pious impostor. Sacerdotal power in India depended on
superstitions carefully fostered concerning the mystical properties of
a stimulating juice (soma), litanies, invocations, and benedictions
by priests; upon sacrifices to the gods, including their priests,
austerities, penances, pilgrimages, and the like; one characteristic
running through all the performances--their utter worthlessness to any
being in the universe except the priest. An artificial system of this
kind has to create its own materials, and evoke forces of evolution
from many regions of nature. It is a process requiring much more
than the wisdom of the serpent and more than its harmfulness; and
there is a bit of nature's irony in the fact that when the Brahman
Rishi gained supremacy, the Cobra was also worshipped as belonging
to precisely the same caste and sanctity.

There are traces of long and fierce struggles preceding this
consummation. Even in the Vedic age--in the very dawn of religious
history--Tetzel appears with his indulgences and Luther confronts
him. The names they bore in ancient India were Viswamitra and
Vasishtha. Both of these were among the seven powerful Rishis who
made the hierarchy of India in the earliest age known to us. Both were
composers of some of the chief hymns of the Vedas, and their respective
hymns bear the stamp of the sacerdotal and the anti-sacerdotal parties
which contended before the priestly sway had reached its complete
triumph. Viswamitra was champion of the high priestly party and its
political pretensions. In the Rig-Veda there are forty hymns ascribed
to him and his family, nearly all of which celebrate the divine
virtues of Soma-juice and the Soma-sacrifice. As the exaltation of
the priestly caste in Israel was connected with a miracle, in which
the Jordan stopped flowing till the ark had been carried over, so
the rivers Sutledge and Reyah were said to have rested from their
course when Viswamitra wished to cross them in seeking the Soma. This
Rishi became identified in the Hindu mind for all time with political
priestcraft. On the other hand, Vasishtha became equally famous for
his hostility to that power, as well as for his profoundly religious
character,--the finest hymns of the Vedas, as to moral feeling, being
those that bear his name. The anti-sacerdotal spirit of Vasishtha is
especially revealed in a strange satirical hymn in which he ridicules
the ceremonial Brahmans under the guise of a panegyric on frogs. In
this composition occur such verses as these:--

'Like Brahmans at the Soma-sacrifice of Atiratra, sitting round a
full pond and talking, you, O frogs, celebrate this day of the year
when the rainy season begins.

'These Brahmans, with their Soma, have had their say, performing the
annual rite. These Adhwaryus, sweating while they carry the hot pots,
pop out like hermits.

'They have always observed the order of the gods as they are to
be worshipped in the twelvemonth; these men do not neglect their
season....

'Cow-noise gave, Goat-noise gave, the Brown gave, and the Green gave
us treasures. The frogs, who give us hundreds of cows, lengthened
our life in the rich autumn.' [17]

Viswamitra and Vasishtha appear to have been powerful rivals in
seeking the confidence of King Sudas, and from their varying fortunes
came the tremendous feud between them which plays so large a part
in the traditions of India. The men were both priests, as are both
ritualists and broad-churchmen in the present day. They were borne
on the stream of mythologic evolution to representative regions
very different from any they could have contemplated. Vasishtha,
ennobled by the moral sentiment of ages, appears as the genius of
truth and justice, maintaining these as of more 'merit' than any
ceremonial perfections. The Brahmans, whom he once ridiculed, were
glad enough in the end to make him their patron saint, though they
did not equally honour his principles. On the other hand, Viswamitra
became the type of that immoral divinity which received its Iranian
anathema in Ahriman. The murder he commits is nothing in a personage
whose Soma-celebrations have raised him so high above the trivialities
of morality.

It is easy to see what must be the further development of such a
type as Viswamitra when he shall have passed from the guarded pages
of puranic tradition to the terrible simplicities of folklore. The
saint whose majesty is built on 'merits,' which have no relation
to what the humble deem virtues, naturally holds such virtues in
cynical contempt; naturally also he is indignant if any one dares
to suggest that the height he has reached by costly and prolonged
observances may be attained by poor and common people through the
practice of virtue. The next step is equally necessary. Since it is
hard to argue down the facts of human nature, Vasishtha is pretty
sure to have a strong, if sometimes silent, support for his heretical
theory of a priesthood representing virtue; consequently Viswamitra
will be reduced at length to deny the existence of virtue, and will
become the Accuser of those to whom virtues are attributed. Finally,
from the Accuser to the Tempter the transition is inevitable. The
public Accuser must try and make good his case, and if the facts do
not support it, he must create other facts which will, or else bear
the last brand of his tribe--Slanderer.

Leaving out of sight all historical or probable facts concerning
Viswamitra and Vasishtha, but remembering the spirit of them, let us
read the great Passion-play of the East, in which their respective
parts are performed again as intervening ages have interpreted
them. The hero of this drama is an ancient king named Harischandra,
who, being childless, and consequently unable to gain immortality,
promised the god Varuna to sacrifice to him a son if one were granted
him. The son having been born, the father beseeches Varuna for respite,
which is granted again and again, but stands firmly by his promise,
although it is finally commuted. The repulsive features of the ancient
legend are eliminated in the drama, the promise now being for a vast
sum of money which the king cannot pay, but which Viswamitra would
tempt him to escape by a technical fiction. Sir Mutu Cumara Swamy,
whose translation I follow, presents many evidences of the near
relation in which this drama stands to the religious faith of the
people in Southern India and parts of Ceylon, where its representation
never fails to draw vast crowds from every part of the district in
which it may occur, the impression made by it being most profound. [18]

We are first introduced to Harischandra, King of Ayodiah (Oude),
in his palace, surrounded by every splendour, and by the devotion
of his prosperous people. His first word is an ascription to the
'God of gods.' His ministers come forward and recount the wealth
and welfare of the nation. The first Act witnesses the marriage of
Harischandra with the beautiful princess Chandravati, and it closes
with the birth of a son.

The second Act brings us into the presence of Indra in the Abode of
the Gods. The Chief enters the Audience Hall of his palace, where an
assembly of deities and sages has awaited him. These sages are holy men
who have acquired supernatural power by their tremendous austerities;
and of these the most august is Viswamitra. By the magnitude and
extent of his austerities he has gained a power beyond even that of
the Triad, and can reduce the worlds to cinders. All the gods court
his favour. As the Council proceeds, Indra addresses the sages--'Holy
men! as gifted with supernatural attributes, you roam the universe
with marvellous speed, there is no place unknown to you. I am curious
to learn who, in the present times, is the most virtuous sovereign on
the earth below. What chief of mortals is there who has never told a
lie--who has never swerved from the course of justice?' Vasishtha,
a powerful sage and family-priest of Harischandra, declares that
his royal disciple is such a man. But the more powerful Viswamitra
denounces Harischandra as cruel and a liar. The quarrel between the
two Rishis waxes fierce, until Indra puts a stop to it by deciding
that an experiment shall be made on Harischandra. Vasishtha agrees
that if his disciple can be shown to have told a lie, or can be made
to tell one, the fruit of his life-long austerities, and all the power
so gained, shall be added to Viswamitra; while the latter must present
his opponent with half of his 'merits' if Harischandra be not made
to swerve from the truth. Viswamitra is to employ any means whatever,
neither Indra or any other interfering.

Viswamitra sets about his task of trying and tempting Harischandra by
informing that king that, in order to perform a sacrifice of special
importance, he has need of a mound of gold as high as a missile
slung by a man standing on an elephant's back. With the demand
of so sacred a being Harischandra has no hesitation in complying,
and is about to deliver the gold when Viswamitra requests him to be
custodian of the money for a time, but perform the customary ceremony
of transfer. Holding Harischandra's written promise to deliver the
gold whensoever demanded, Viswamitra retires with compliments. Then
wild beasts ravage Harischandra's territory; these being expelled,
a demon boar is sent, but is vanquished by the monarch. Viswamitra
then sends unchaste dancing-girls to tempt Harischandra; and when he
has ordered their removal, Viswamitra returns with them, and, feigning
rage, accuses him of slaying innocent beasts and of cruelty to the
girls. He declares that unless Harischandra yields to the Pariah
damsels, he himself shall be reduced to a Pariah slave. Harischandra
offers all his kingdom and possessions if the demand is withdrawn,
absolutely refusing to swerve from his virtue. This Viswamitra accepts,
is proclaimed sovereign of Ayodiah, and the king goes forth a beggar
with his wife and child. But now, as these are departing, Viswamitra
demands that mound of gold which was to be paid when called for. In
vain Harischandra pleads that he has already delivered up all he
possesses, the gold included; the last concession is declared to
have nothing to do with the first. Yet Viswamitra says he will
be charitable; if Harischandra will simply declare that he never
pledged the gold, or, having done so, does not feel bound to pay it,
he will cancel that debt. 'Such a declaration I can never make,'
replies Harischandra. 'I owe thee the gold, and pay it I shall. Let a
messenger accompany me and leave me not till I have given him thy due.'

From this time the efforts of Viswamitra are directed to induce
Harischandra to declare the money not due. Amid his heartbroken
people--who cry, 'Where are the gods? Can they tolerate this?'--he who
was just now the greatest and happiest monarch in the world goes forth
on the highway a wanderer with his Chandravati and their son Devarata
dressed in coarsest garments. His last royal deed is to set the crown
on his tempter's head. The people and officers follow, and beg his
permission to slay Viswamitra, but he rebukes them, and counsels
submission. Viswamitra orders a messenger, Nakshatra, to accompany
the three wretched ones, and inflict the severest sufferings on them
until the gold is paid, and amid each ordeal to offer Harischandra
all his former wealth and happiness if he will utter a falsehood.

They come to a desert whose sands are so hot that the wife
faints. Harischandra bears his son in his arms, but in addition
is compelled to bear Nakshatra (the Brahman and tormentor) on his
shoulders. They so pass amid snakes and scorpions, and receive
terrible stings; they pass through storm and flood, and yet vainly
does Nakshatra suggest the desired falsehood.

Then follows the ordeal of Demons, which gives an interesting insight
into Tamil Demonology. One of the company exclaims--'How frightful
they look! Who can face them? They come in battalions, young and old,
small and great--all welcome us. They disport themselves with a wild
dance; flames shoot from their mouths; their feet touch not the earth;
they move in the air. Observe you the bleeding corpses of human
beings in their hands. They crunch them and feed on the flesh. The
place is one mass of gore and filth. Wolves and hyaenas bark at them;
jackals and dogs follow them. They are near. May Siva protect us!'

Nakshatra. How dreadful! Harischandra, what is this? Look! evil demons
stare at me--I tremble for my life. Protect me now, and I ask you no
more for the gold.

Harischandra. Have no fear, Nakshatra. Come, place thyself in the
midst of us.

Chief of the Goblins. Men! little men! human vermin! intrude ye thus
into my presence? Know that, save only the Brahman standing in the
midst of you, you are all my prey to-night.

Harischandra. Goblin! certainly thou art not an evil-doer, for thou
hast excepted this holy Brahman. As for ourselves, we know that the
bodies which begin to exist upon earth must also cease to exist on
it. What matters it when death comes? If he spares us now he reserves
us only for another season. Good, kind demon! destroy us then together;
here we await our doom.

Nakshatra. Harischandra! before you thus desert me, make the goblin
promise you that he will not hurt me.

Harischandra. Thou hast no cause for alarm; thou art safe.

Chief of the Goblins. Listen! I find that all four of you are very
thin; it is not worth my while to kill you. On examining closely, I
perceive that the young Brahman is plump and fat as a wild boar. Give
him up to me--I want not the rest.

Nakshatra. O Gods! O Harischandra! you are a great monarch! Have
mercy on me! Save me, save me! I will never trouble you for the gold,
but treat you considerately hereafter.

Harischandra. Sir, thy life is safe, stand still.

Nakshatra. Allow me, sirs, to come closer to you, and to hold you by
the hand (He grasps their hands.)

Harischandra. King of the Goblins! I address thee in all sincerity;
thou wilt confer on us a great favour indeed by despatching us
speedily to the Judgment Hall of the God of Death. The Brahman must
not be touched; devour us.

The Goblin (grinding his teeth in great fury). What! dare you disobey
me? Will you not deliver the Brahman?

Harischandra. No, we cannot. We alone are thy victims.

[Day breaks, and the goblins disappear.]

Having thus withstood all temptation to harm his enemy, or to break
a promise he had given to treat him kindly, Harischandra is again
pressed for the gold or the lie, and, still holding out, an ordeal of
fire follows. Trusting the God of Fire will cease to afflict if one is
sacrificed, Harischandra prepares to enter the conflagration first,
and a pathetic contention occurs between him and his wife and son
as to which shall be sacrificed. In the end Harischandra rushes in,
but does not perish.

Harischandra is hoping to reach the temple of Vis Wanath [19] at Kasi
and invoke his aid to pay the gold. To the temple he comes only to
plead in vain, and Nakshatra tortures him with instruments. Finally
Harischandra, his wife and child, are sold as slaves to pay
the debt. But Viswamitra, invisibly present, only redoubles his
persecutions. Harischandra is subjected to the peculiar degradation
of having to burn dead bodies in a cemetery. Chandravati and her son
are subjected to cruelties. The boy is one day sent to the forest,
is bitten by a snake, and dies. Chandravati goes out in the night to
find the body. She repairs with it to the cemetery. In the darkness
she does not recognise her husband, the burner of the bodies, nor he
his wife. He has strictly promised his master that every fee shall be
paid, and reproaches the woman for coming in the darkness to avoid
payment. Chandravati offers in payment a sacred chain which Siva
had thrown round her neck at birth, invisible to all but a perfect
man. Harischandra alone has ever seen it, and now recognises his
wife. But even now he will not perform the last rites over his dead
child unless the fee can be obtained as promised. Chandravati goes
out into the city to beg the money, leaving Harischandra seated beside
the dead body of Devarata. In the street she stumbles over the corpse
of another child, and takes it up; it proves to be the infant Prince,
who has been murdered. Chandravati--arrested and dragged before the
king--in a state of frenzy declares she has killed the child. She is
condemned to death, and her husband must be her executioner. But the
last scene must be quoted nearly in full.

Verakvoo (Harischandra's master, leading on Chandravati). Slave! this
woman has been sentenced by our king to be executed without delay. Draw
your sword and cut her head off. (Exit.)

Harischandra. I obey, master. (Draws the sword and approaches her.)

Chandravati (coming to consciousness again). My husband! What! do I
see thee again? I applaud thy resolution, my lord. Yes; let me die
by thy sword. Be not unnerved, but be prompt, and perform thy duty
unflinchingly.

Harischandra. My beloved wife! the days allotted to you in
this world are numbered; you have run through the span of your
existence. Convicted as you are of this crime, there is no hope for
your life; I must presently fulfil my instructions. I can only allow
you a few seconds; pray to your tutelary deities, prepare yourself
to meet your doom.

Viswamitra (who has suddenly appeared). Harischandra! what, are you
going to slaughter this poor woman? Wicked man, spare her! Tell a
lie even now and be restored to your former state!

Harischandra. I pray, my lord, attempt not to beguile me from the path
of rectitude. Nothing shall shake my resolution; even though thou didst
offer to me the throne of Indra I would not tell a lie. Pollute not thy
sacred person by entering such unholy grounds. Depart! I dread not thy
wrath; I no longer court thy favour. Depart. (Viswamitra disappears.)

My love! lo I am thy executioner; come, lay thy head gently on this
block with thy sweet face turned towards the east. Chandravati,
my wife, be firm, be happy! The last moment of our sufferings has
at length come; for to sufferings too there is happily an end. Here
cease our woes, our griefs, our pleasures. Mark! yet awhile, and thou
wilt be as free as the vultures that now soar in the skies.

This keen sabre will do its duty. Thou dead, thy husband dies too--this
self-same sword shall pierce my breast. First the child--then the
wife--last the husband--all victims of a sage's wrath. I the martyr of
Truth--thou and thy son martyrs for me, the martyr of Truth. Yes; let
us die cheerfully and bear our ills meekly. Yes; let all men perish,
let all gods cease to exist, let the stars that shine above grow dim,
let all seas be dried up, let all mountains be levelled to the ground,
let wars rage, blood flow in streams, let millions of millions of
Harischandras be thus persecuted; yet let Truth be maintained--let
Truth ride victorious over all--let Truth be the light--Truth the
guide--Truth alone the lasting solace of mortals and immortals. Die,
then, O goddess of Chastity! Die, at this the shrine of thy sister
goddess of Truth!

[Strikes the neck of Chandravati with great force; the sword, instead
of harming her, is transformed into a string of superb pearls, which
winds itself around her: the gods of heaven, all sages, and all kings
appear suddenly to the view of Harischandra.]

Siva (the first of the gods). Harischandra, be ever blessed! You have
borne your severe trials most heroically, and have proved to all men
that virtue is of greater worth than all the vanities of a fleeting
world. Be you the model of mortals. Return to your land, resume your
authority, and rule your state. Devarata, victim of Viswamitra's wrath,
rise! (He is restored to life.)

Rise you, also, son of the King of Kasi, with whose murder you,
Chandravati, were charged through the machinations of Viswamitra. (He
comes to life also.)

Harischandra. All my misfortunes are of little consequence, since thou,
O God of gods, hast deigned to favour me with thy divine presence. No
longer care I for kingdom, or power, or glory. I value not children, or
wives, or relations. To thy service, to thy worship, to the redemption
of my erring soul, I devote myself uninterruptedly hereafter. Let me
not become the sport of men. The slave of a Pariah cannot become a
king; the slave-girl of a Brahman cannot become a queen. When once the
milk has been drawn from the udder of a cow nothing can restore the
self-same milk to it. Our degradation, O God, is now beyond redemption.

Viswamitra. I pray, O Siva, that thou wouldst pardon my folly. Anxious
to gain the wager laid by me before the gods, I have most mercilessly
tormented this virtuous king; yet he has proved himself the most
truthful of all earthly sovereigns, triumphing victoriously over
me and my efforts to divert him from his constancy. Harischandra,
king of kings! I crave your forgiveness.

Verakvoo (throwing off his disguise). King Harischandra, think not
that I am a Pariah, for you behold in me even Yama, the God of Death.

Kalakanda (Chandravati's cruel master, throwing off his
disguise). Queen! rest not in the belief that you were the slave
of a Brahman. He to whom you devoted yourself am even I--the God of
Fire, Agni.

Vasishtha. Harischandra, no disgrace attaches to thee nor to the Solar
race, of which thou art the incomparable gem. Even this cemetery
is in reality no cemetery: see! the illusion lasts not, and thou
beholdest here a holy grove the abode of hermits and ascetics. Like
the gold which has passed through successive crucibles, devoid of all
impurities, thou, O King of Ayodiah, shinest in greater splendour than
even yon god of light now rising to our view on the orient hills. (It
is morning.)

Siva. Harischandra, let not the world learn that Virtue is vanquished,
and that its enemy, Vice, has become the victor. Go, mount yon throne
again--proclaim to all that we, the gods, are the guardians of the
good and the true. Indra! chief of the gods, accompany this sovereign
with all your retinue, and recrown him emperor of Ayodiah. May his
reign be long--may all bliss await him in the other world!



The plot of this drama has probably done as much and as various duty
as any in the world. It has spread like a spiritual banyan, whose
branches, taking root, have swelled to such size that it is difficult
now to say which is the original trunk. It may even be that the only
root they all had in common is an invisible one in the human heart,
developed in its necessary struggles amid nature after the pure and
perfect life.

But neither in the Book of Job, which we are yet to consider, nor in
any other variation of the theme, does it rise so high as in this drama
of Harischandra. In Job it represents man loyal to his deity amid the
terrible afflictions which that deity permits; but in Harischandra
it shows man loyal to a moral principle even against divine orders
to the contrary. Despite the hand of the licenser, and the priestly
manipulations, visible here and there in it--especially towards the
close--sacerdotalism stands confronted by its reaction at last, and
receives its sentence in the joy with which the Hindu sees the potent
Rishis with all their pretentious 'merits,' and the gods themselves,
kneeling at the feet of the man who stands by Truth.

It is amusing to find the wincings of the priests through many
centuries embodied in a legend about Harischandra after he went to
heaven. It is related that he was induced by Narada to relate his
actions with such unbecoming pride that he was lowered from Svarga
(heaven) one stage after each sentence; but having stopped in time,
and paid homage to the gods, he was placed with his capital in mid-air,
where eyes sacerdotally actinised may still see the aerial city at
certain times. The doctrine of 'merits' will no doubt be able for
some time yet to charge 'good deeds' with their own sin--pride; but,
after all, the priest must follow the people far enough to confess that
one must look upward to find the martyr of Truth. In what direction
one must look to find his accuser requires no further intimation than
the popular legend of Viswamitra.







CHAPTER V.

ELOHIM AND JEHOVAH.

Deified power--Giants and Jehovah--Jehovah's manifesto--The various
Elohim--Two Jehovahs and two Tables--Contradictions--Detachment
of the Elohim from Jehovah.


The sacred books of the Hebrews bring us into the presence
of the gods (Elohim) supposed to have created all things out
of nothing--nature-gods--just as they are in transition to the
conception of a single Will and Personality. Though the plural is
used ('gods') a singular verb follows: the tendency is already to
that concentration which resulted in the enthronement of one supreme
sovereign--Jehovah. The long process of evolution which must have
preceded this conception is but slightly traceable in the Bible. It
is, however, written on the face of the whole world, and the same
process is going on now in its every phase. Whether with Gesenius
[20] we take the sense of the word Elohim to be 'the revered,' or,
with Furst, [21] 'the mighty,' makes little difference; the fact
remains that the word is applied elsewhere to gods in general,
including such as were afterwards deemed false gods by the Jews;
and it is more important still that the actions ascribed to the
Elohim, who created the heavens and the earth, generally reflect
the powerful and un-moral forces of nature. The work of creation in
Genesis (i. and ii. 1-3) is that of giants without any moral quality
whatever. Whether or not we take in their obvious sense the words,
'Elohim created man in his own image, ... male and female created
he them,' there can be no question of the meaning of Gen. vi. 1, 2:
'The sons of Elohim saw the daughters of men that they were beautiful,
and they took to themselves for wives whomsoever they chose.' When
good and evil come to be spoken of, the name Jehovah [22] at once
appears. The Elohim appear again in the Flood, the wind that assuaged
it, the injunction to be fruitful and multiply, the cloud and rainbow;
and gradually the germs of a moral government begin to appear in their
assigning the violence of mankind as reason for the deluge, and in
the covenant with Noah. But even after the name Jehovah had generally
blended with, or even superseded, the other, we find Elohim often
used where strength and wonder-working are thought of--e.g., 'Thou
art the god that doest wonders' (Ps. lxxvii.). 'Thy way is in the sea,
and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.'

Against the primitive nature-deities the personality and jealous
supremacy of Jehovah was defined. The golden calf built by Aaron was
called Elohim (plural, though there was but one calf). Solomon was
denounced for building altars to the same; and when Jeroboam built
altars to two calves, they are still so called. Other rivals--Dagon
(Judges xvi.), Astaroth, Chemosh, Milcom (1 Kings xi.)--are called
by the once-honoured name. The English Bible translates Elohim, God;
Jehovah, the Lord; Jehovah Elohim, the Lord God; and the critical
reader will find much that is significant in the varied use of these
names. Thus (Gen. xxii.) it is Elohim that demands the sacrifice
of Isaac, Jehovah that interferes to save him. At the same time, in
editing the story, it is plainly felt to be inadmissible that Abraham
should be supposed loyal to any other god than Jehovah; so Jehovah
adopts the sacrifice as meant for himself, and the place where the
ram was provided in place of Isaac is called Jehovah-Jireh. However,
when we can no longer distinguish the two antagonistic conceptions
by different names their actual incongruity is even more salient,
and, as we shall see, develops a surprising result.

Jehovah inaugurates his reign by a manifesto against these giants,
the Elohim, for whom the special claim--clamorously asserted when
Aaron built the Golden Calf, and continued as the plea for the same
deity--was that they (Elohim) had brought Israel out of Egypt. 'I,'
cries Jehovah, 'am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the
land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage: thou shalt have no other
gods but me;' and the first four commandments of the law are devoted
entirely to a declaration of his majesty, his power (claiming credit
for the creation), his jealous determination to punish his opponents
and reward his friends, to vindicate the slightest disrespect to his
name. The narrative of the Golden Calf was plainly connected with
Sinai in order to illustrate the first commandment. The punishment of
the believers in another divine emancipator, even though they had not
yet received the proclamation, must be signal. Jehovah is so enraged
that by his order human victims are offered up to the number of three
thousand, and even after that, it is said, Jehovah plagued Israel on
account of their Elohim-worship. In the same direction is the command
to keep holy the Sabbath day, because on it he rested from the work
of creation (Gen. xx.), or because on that day he delivered Israel
from Egypt (Deut. v.), the editors do not seem to remember exactly
which, but it is well enough to say both, for it is taking the two
picked laurels from the brow of Elohim and laying them on that of
Jehovah. In all of which it is observable that there is no moral
quality whatever. Nero might equally command the Romans to have no
other gods before himself, to speak his name with awe, to rest when
he stopped working. In the fifth commandment, arbitrarily ascribed to
the First Table, we have a transition to the moral code; though even
there the honour of parents is jealously associated with Jehovah's
greatness ('that thy days may be long in the land which Jehovah
Elohim giveth thee'). The nature-gods were equal to that; for the
Elohim had begotten the giants who were 'in the earth in those days.'

'Elohim spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am Jehovah; and I
appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob by (the name of) God
Almighty (El-Shaddai), but by my name Jehovah was I not known to them'
(Exod. vi. 2, 3).

The ancient gods--the Elohim--were, in the process of absorption
into the one great form, the repository of their several powers,
distinguishable; and though, for the most part, they bear names related
to the forces of nature, now and then they reflect the tendencies
to humanisation. Thus we have 'the most high god' (El-elyon--e.g.,
Gen. xiv. 18); 'the everlasting-god' (El-elim, Gen. xxi. 33); 'the
jealous god' (El-kana, Exod. xx. 5); 'the mighty god, and terrible'
(El-gadol and nora, Deut. vii. 21); 'the living god' (El-chi,
Josh. iii. 10); 'the god of heaven' (El-shemim, Ps. cxxxvi. 26);
the 'god almighty' (El-shaddai, [23] Exod. vi. 2). These Elohim,
with each of whose names I have referred to an instance of its
characteristic use, became epithets, as the powers they represented
were more and more absorbed by the growing personality of Jehovah; but
these epithets were also characters, and their historic expressions
had also to undergo a process of slow and difficult digestion. The
all-devouring grandeur of Jehovah showed what it had fed on. Not only
all the honours, but many of the dishonours, of the primitive deities
adhered to the sovereign whose rule was no doubt inaugurated by their
disgrace and their barbarism. The costliness of the glory of divine
absolutism is again illustrated in the evolution of the premature
monotheism, which had for its figure-head the dread Jehovah, who,
as heir of the nature-gods, became responsible for the monstrosities
of a tribal demonolatry, thus being compelled to fill simultaneously
the roles of the demon and the lawgiver. [24]

The two tables of the law--one written by Jehovistic theology, the
other by the moral sense of mankind--ascribed to this dual deity, for
whom unity was so fiercely insisted on, may be read in their outcome
throughout the Bible. They are here briefly, in a few examples,
set forth side by side.


TABLE OF JEHOVAH I.                 TABLE OF JEHOVAH II.

Exod. xxxiii. 27. 'Slay every       Exod. xx. 13. 'Thou shalt not

neighbour.'

Num. xv. 32. 'While the children    Exod. xx. 14. 'Thou shalt not

they found a man that gathered
sticks upon the Sabbath Day....
And they put him in ward, because
it was not declared what should
be done to him. And the Lord said
unto Moses, The man shall be
surely put to death: all the
congregation shall stone him with
stones without the camp.' Neither
this nor the similar punishment
for blasphemy (Lev. xxiv.), were
executions of existing law. For a
fearful instance of murder
inflicted on the innocent, and
accepted as a human sacrifice by
Jehovah, see 2 Sam. xxi.; and for
the brutal murder of Shimei, who
denounced and resented the crime
which hung the seven sons of Saul
'before the Lord,' see 1 Kings ii.
But the examples are many.

In the story of Abraham, Sarai,
and Hagar (Gen. xvi.), Lot and
his daughters (xix.), Abraham's
presentation of his wife to
Abimilech (xx.), the same done by
Isaac (xxvi.), Judah, Tamar
(xxxviii.), and other cases where
the grossest violations of the
seventh commandment go unrebuked
by Jehovah, while in constant
communication with the guilty
parties, we see how little the
second table was supported by
the first.

The extortions, frauds, and         Exod. xx. 15. 'Thou shalt not
thefts of Jacob (Gen. xxv.,         steal.'
xxvii., xxx.), which brought upon
him the unparalleled blessings of
Jehovah; the plundering of
Nabal's property by David and his
fellow-bandits; the smiting of
the robbed farmer by Jehovah and
the taking of his treacherous
wife by David (1 Sam. xxv.), are
narratives befitting a Bible of
footpads.

Jehovah said, 'Who shall deceive    Exod. xx. 16. 'Thou shalt not
Ahab?... And there came forth a     bear false witness against thy
spirit, and stood before Jehovah,   neighbour.'
and said, I will deceive him. And
Jehovah said, Wherewith? And he
said, I will go forth and be a
lying spirit in the mouth of all
these thy prophets. And he said,
Thou shalt deceive him, and
prevail also: go forth and do so.
Now, therefore, Jehovah hath put
a lying spirit in the mouth of
all these thy prophets, and
Jehovah hath spoken evil
concerning thee' (1 Kings xxii.).
See Ezek. xx. 25.

Deut xx. 10-18, is a complete       Exod. xx. 17. 'Thou shalt not
instruction for invasion, murder,   covet they neighbour's wife,
rapine, eating the spoil of the     thou shalt not covet thy
invaded, taking their wives,        neighbour's wife, nor his
their cattle, &c., all such as      man-servant, nor his maid-
might have been proclaimed by a     servant, nor his ox, nor his
Supreme Bashi-Bazouk.               ass, nor anything that is thy
                                    neighbour's.'


Instances of this discrepancy might be largely multiplied. Any one who
cares to pursue the subject can trace the building upon the powerful
personal Jehovah of a religion of human sacrifices, anathemas, and
priestly despotism; while around the moral ruler and judge of the
same name, whose personality is more and more dispersed in pantheistic
ascriptions, there grows the common law, and then the more moral law
of equity, and the corresponding sentiments which gradually evolve
the idea of a parental deity.

It is obvious that the more this second idea of the deity prevails,
the more he is regarded as 'merciful,' 'long-suffering,' 'a God
of truth and without iniquity, just and right,' 'delighting not in
sacrifice but mercifulness,' 'good to all,' and whose 'tender mercies
are over all his works,' and having 'no pleasure in the death of him
that dieth;' the less will it be possible to see in the very same
being the 'man of war,' 'god of battles,' the 'jealous,' 'angry,'
'fire-breathing' one, who 'visits the sins of the fathers upon the
children,' who laughs at the calamities of men and mocks when their
fear cometh. It is a structural necessity of the human mind that
these two shall be gradually detached the one from the other. From
one of the Jehovahs represented in parallel columns came the 'Father'
whom Christ adored: from the other came the Devil he abhorred.







CHAPTER VI.

THE CONSUMING FIRE.

The Shekinah--Jewish idols--Attributes of the fiery and
cruel Elohim compared with those of the Devil--The powers of
evil combined under a head--Continuity--The consuming fire
spiritualised.


That Abraham was a Fire-worshipper might be suspected from the
immemorial efforts of all Semitic authorities to relieve him of
traditional connection with that particular idolatry. When the good
and evil powers were being distinguished, we find the burning and
the bright aspects of Fire severally regarded. The sign of Jehovah's
covenant with Abram included both. 'It came to pass that when the sun
went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace and a burning
lamp that passed between those pieces' (of the sacrifice). In the
legend of Moses we have the glory resting on Sinai and the burning
bush, the bush which, it is specially remarked, was 'not consumed,'
an exceptional circumstance in honour of Moses. To these corresponded
the Urim and Thummim, marking the priest as source of light and
of judgment. In his favourable and adorable aspect Jehovah was the
Brightness of Fire. This was the Shekinah. In the Targum, Jonathan
Ben Uzziel to the Prophets, it is said: 'The mountains trembled
before the Lord; the mountains Tabor, Hermon, Carmel said one to the
other: Upon me the Shekinah will rest, and to me will it come. But
the Shekinah rested upon Mount Sinai, weakest and smallest of all the
mountains. This Sinai trembled and shook, and its smoke went up as the
smoke of an oven, because of the glory of the God of Israel which had
manifested itself upon it.' The Brightness [25] passed on to illumine
every event associated with the divine presence in Semitic mythology;
it was 'the glory of the Lord' shining from the Star of Bethlehem,
and the figure of the Transfiguration.

The Consuming Fire also had its development. Among the spiritual
it was spiritualised. 'Who among us shall dwell with the Devouring
Fire?' cries Isaiah. 'Who among us shall dwell with the Everlasting
Burnings? He that walketh righteously and speaketh uprightly; he
that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from
holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood,
and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil.' It was by a prosaic route
that the Devouring Fire became the residence of the wicked.

After Jeroboam (1 Kings xiii.) had built altars to the Elohim,
under form of Calves, a prophet came out of Judah to denounce the
idolatry. 'And he cried against the altar in the word of Jehovah,
and said, O altar, altar! thus saith Jehovah, Behold, a child shall
be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall
he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee,
and men's bones shall be burnt upon thee.' It was deemed so important
that this prophecy should be fulfilled in the letter, when it could
no longer be fulfilled in reality, that some centuries later Josiah
dug up the bones of the Elohistic priests and burned them upon their
long-ruined altars (2 Kings xxiii.).

The incident is significant, both on account of the prophet's
personification of the altar, and the institution of a sort of Gehenna
in connection with it. The personification and the Gehenna became
much more complete as time went on. The Jews originally had no Devil,
as indeed had no races at first; and this for the obvious reason
that their so-called gods were quite equal to any moral evils that
were to be accounted for, as we have already seen they were adequate
to explain all physical evils. But the antagonists of the moral
Jehovah were recognised and personified with increasing clearness,
and were quite prepared for connection with any General who might be
theoretically proposed for their leadership. When the Jews came under
the influence of Persian theology the archfiend was elected, and all
the Elohim--Moloch, Dagon, Astarte, Chemosh, and the rest--took their
place under his rebellious ensign.

The descriptions of the Devil in the Bible are mainly borrowed from
the early descriptions of the Elohim, and of Jehovah in his Elohistic
character. [26] In the subjoined parallels I follow the received
English version.

In addition to the above passages may be cited a notable passage from
Paul's Epistle to the Thessalonians (ii. 3). 'Let no man deceive you
by any means: for that day (of Christ) shall not come, except there
come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son
of perdition; who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is
called God, or that is worshipped; so that he, as God, sitteth in the
temple of God, showing himself that he is God. Remember ye not that,
when I was yet with you, I told you these things? And now ye know what
withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time. For the mystery of
iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he
be taken out of the way: and then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom
the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy
with the brightness of his coming: even him whose coming is after the
working of Satan, with all power, and signs, and lying wonders, and
with all the deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish;
because they received not the love of the truth, that they might
be saved. And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion,
that they should believe a lie; that they all might be damned who
believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.'

This remarkable utterance shows how potent was the survival in the
mind of Paul of the old Elohist belief. Although the ancient deity,
who deceived prophets to their destruction, and sent forth lying
spirits with their strong delusions, was dethroned and outlawed, he was
still a powerful claimant of empire, haunting the temple, and setting
himself up therein as God. He will be consumed by Christ's breath when
the day of triumph comes; but meanwhile he is not only allowed great
power in the earth, but utilised by the true God, who even so far
cooperates with the false as to send on some men 'strong delusions'
('a working of error,' Von Tischendorf translates), in order that
they may believe the lie and be damned. Paul speaks of the 'mystery
of iniquity;' but it is not so very mysterious when we consider the
antecedents of his idea. The dark problem of the origin of evil, and
its continuance in the universe under the rule of a moral governor,
still threw its impenetrable shadow across the human mind. It was a
terrible reality, visible in the indifference or hostility with which
the new gospel was met on the part of the cultured and powerful; and it
could only then be explained as a mysterious provisional arrangement
connected with some divine purpose far away in the depths of the
universe. But the passage quoted from Thessalonians shows plainly
that all those early traditions about the divinely deceived prophets
and lying spirits, sent forth from Jehovah Elohim, had finally, in
Paul's time, become marshalled under a leader, a personal Man of Sin;
but this leader, while opposing Christ's kingdom, is in some mysterious
way a commissioner of God.

We may remark here the beautiful continuity by which, through all
these shadows of terror and vapours of speculation, 'clouding the
glow of heaven,' [27] the unquenchable ideal from first to last is
steadily ascending.

'One or three things,' says the Talmud, 'were before this world--Water,
Fire, and Wind. Water begat the Darkness, Fire begat Light, and
Wind begat the Spirit of Wisdom.' This had become the rationalistic
translation by a crude science of the primitive demons, once believed
to have created the heavens and the earth. In the process we find
the forces outlawed in their wild action, but becoming the choir of
God in their quiet action:--

1 Kings xix. 11-13. 'And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount
before the Lord. And, behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and
strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before
the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind: and after the wind an
earthquake; but the Lord was not in the earthquake: and after the
earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the
fire a still small voice. And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that
he wrapped his face in his mantle.'

But man must have a philosophical as well as a moral development: the
human mind could not long endure this elemental anarchy. It asked,
If the Lord be not in the hurricane, the earthquake, the volcanic
flame, who is therein? This is the answer of the Targum: [28]

'And he said, Arise and stand on the mountain before the Lord. And
God revealed himself: and before him a host of angels of the wind,
cleaving the mountain and breaking the rocks before the Lord; but
not in the host of angels was the Shechinah. And after the host of
the angels of the wind came a host of angels of commotion; but not in
the host of the angels of commotion was the Shechinah of the Lord. And
after the angels of commotion came a host of angels of fire; but not
in the host of angels of fire was the Shechinah of the Lord. But after
the host of the angels of the fire came voices singing in silence. And
it was when Elijah heard this he hid his face in his mantle.'

The moral sentiment takes another step in advance with the unknown but
artistic writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews. Moses had described
God as a 'consuming fire;' and 'the sight of the glory of the Lord
was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the
children of Israel' (Exod. xxiv. 17). When next we meet this phrase it
is with this writer, who seeks to supersede what Moses (traditionally)
built up. 'Whose voice,' he says, 'then shook the earth; but now he
hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but
also heaven. And this word, 'yet once more,' signifieth the removing
of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those
which cannot be shaken may remain.... For our God is a consuming fire.'

'Our God also!' cries each great revolution that advances. His
consuming wrath is not now directed against man, but the errors
which are man's only enemies: the lightnings of the new Sinai, while
they enlighten the earth, smite the old heaven of human faith and
imagination, shrivelling it like a burnt scroll!

In this nineteenth century, when the old heaven, amid which this
fiery pillar glowed, is again shaken, the ancient phrase has still
its meaning. The Russian Tourgenieff represents two friends who had
studied together in early life, then parted, accidentally meeting
once more for a single night. They compare notes as to what the long
intervening years have taught them; and one sums his experience in the
words--'I have burned what I used to worship, and worship what I used
to burn.' The novelist artfully reproduces for this age a sentence
associated with a crisis in the religious history of Europe. Clovis,
King of the Franks, invoked the God of his wife Clotilda to aid him
against the Germans, vowing to become a Christian if successful; and
when, after his victory, he was baptized at Rheims, St. Remy said to
him--'Bow thy head meekly, Sicambrian; burn what thou hast worshipped,
and worship what thou hast burned!' Clovis followed the Bishop's advice
in literal fashion, carrying fire and sword amid his old friends the
'Pagans' right zealously. But the era has come in which that which
Clovis' sword and St. Remy's theology set up for worship is being
consumed in its turn. Tourgenieff's youths are consuming the altar on
which their forerunners were consumed. And in this rekindled flame the
world now sees shrivelling the heavens once fresh, but now reflecting
the aggregate selfishness of mankind, the hells representing their
aggregate cowardice, and feeds its nobler faith with this vision of the
eternal fire which evermore consumes the false and refines the world.







CHAPTER VII.

PARADISE AND THE SERPENT.

Herakles and Athena in a holy picture--Human significance of
Eden--The legend in Genesis puzzling--Silence of later books
concerning it--Its Vedic elements--Its explanation--Episode of
the Mahabharata--Scandinavian variant--The name of Adam--The
story re-read--Rabbinical interpretations.


Montfaucon has among his plates one (XX.) representing an antique
agate which he supposes to represent Zeus and Athena, but which
probably relates to the myth of Herakles and Athena in the garden of
Hesperides. The hero having penetrated this garden, slays the dragon
which guards its immortalising fruit, but when he has gathered this
fruit Athena takes it from him, lest man shall eat it and share the
immortality of the gods. In this design the two stand on either side of
the tree, around which a serpent is twined from root to branches. The
history which Montfaucon gives of the agate is of equal interest
with the design itself. It was found in an old French cathedral,
where it had long been preserved and shown as a holy picture of the
Temptation. It would appear also to have previously deceived some
rabbins, for on the border is written in Hebrew characters, much
more modern than the central figures, 'The woman saw that the tree
was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree
to be desired to make one wise.'

This mystification about a design, concerning whose origin and design
there is now no doubt, is significant. The fable of Paradise and
the Serpent is itself more difficult to trace, so many have been the
races and religions which have framed it with their holy texts and
preserved it in their sacred precincts. In its essence, no doubt,
the story grows from a universal experience; in that aspect it is a
mystical rose that speaks all languages. When man first appears his
counterpart is a garden. The moral nature means order. The wild forces
of nature--the Elohim--build no fence, forbid no fruit. They say to
man as the supreme animal, Subdue the earth; every tree and herb shall
be your meat; every animal your slave; be fruitful and multiply. But
from the conflict the more real man emerges, and his sign is a garden
hedged in from the wilderness, and a separation between good and evil.

The form in which the legend appears in the Book of Genesis presents
one side in which it is simple and natural. This has already been
suggested (vol. i. p. 330). But the legend of man defending his refuge
from wild beasts against the most subtle of them is here overlaid by
a myth in which it plays the least part. The mind which reads it by
such light as may be obtained only from biblical sources can hardly
fail to be newly puzzled at every step. So much, indeed, is confessed
in the endless and diverse theological theories which the story has
elicited. What is the meaning of the curse on the Serpent that it
should for ever crawl thereafter? Had it not crawled previously? Why
was the Tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil forbidden? Why,
when its fruit was tasted, should the Tree of Life have been for the
first time forbidden and jealously guarded? These riddles are nowhere
solved in the Bible, and have been left to the fanciful inventions
of theologians and the ingenuity of rabbins. Dr. Adam Clarke thought
the Serpent was an ape before his sin, and many rabbins concluded he
was camel-shaped; but the remaining enigmas have been fairly given up.

The ancient Jews, they who wrote and compiled the Old Testament, more
candid than their modern descendants and our omniscient christians,
silently confessed their inability to make anything out of this
snake-story. From the third chapter of Genesis to the last verse of
Malachi the story is not once alluded to! Such a phenomenon would
have been impossible had this legend been indigenous with the Hebrew
race. It was clearly as a boulder among them which had floated from
regions little known to their earlier writers; after lying naked
through many ages, it became overgrown with rabbinical lichen and
moss, and, at the Christian era, while it seemed part of the Hebrew
landscape, it was exceptional enough to receive special reverence as
a holy stone. That it was made the corner-stone of Christian theology
may be to some extent explained by the principle of omne ignotum pro
mirifico. But the boulder itself can only be explained by tracing it
to the mythologic formation from which it crumbled.

How would a Parsi explain the curse on a snake which condemned it to
crawl? He would easily give us evidence that at the time when most
of those Hebrew Scriptures were written, without allusion to such
a Serpent, the ancient Persians believed that Ahriman had tempted
the first man and woman through his evil mediator, his anointed son,
Ash-Mogh, 'the two-footed Serpent.'

But let us pass beyond the Persian legend, carrying that and the
biblical story together, for submission to the criticism of a
Brahman. He will tell us that this Ash-Mogh of the Parsi is merely
the ancient Aeshma-daeva of the Avesta, which in turn is Ahi, the
great Vedic Serpent-monster whom Indra 'prostrated beneath the feet'
of the stream he had obstructed--every stream having its deity. He
would remind us that the Vedas describe the earliest dragon-slayer,
Indra, as 'crushing the head' of his enemy, and that this figure of
the god with his heel on a Serpent's head has been familiar to his race
from time immemorial. And he would then tell us to read the Rig-Veda,
v. 32, and the Mahabharata, and we would find all the elements of
the story told in Genesis.

In the hymn referred to we find a graphic account of how, when Ahi
was sleeping on the waters he obstructed, Indra hurled at him his
thunderbolt. It says that when Indra had 'annihilated the weapon of
that mighty beast from him (Ahi), another, more powerful, conceiving
himself one and unmatched, was generated,' This 'wrath-born son,'
'a walker in darkness,' had managed to get hold of the sacred Soma,
the plant monopolised by the gods, and having drunk this juice, he
lay slumbering and 'enveloping the world,' and then 'fierce Indra
seized upon him,' and having previously discovered 'the vital part
of him who thought, himself invulnerable,' struck that incarnation
of many-formed Ahi, and he was 'made the lowest of all creatures'.

But one who has perused the philological biography of Ahi already
given, vol. i. p. 357, will not suppose that this was the end of
him. We must now consider in further detail the great episode
of the Mahabharata, to which reference has been made in other
connections. [29] During the Deluge the most precious treasure of
the gods, the Amrita, the ambrosia that rendered them immortal, was
lost, and the poem relates how the Devas and Asuras, otherwise gods
and serpents, together churned the ocean for it. There were two great
mountains,--Meru the golden and beautiful, adorned with healing plants,
pleasant streams and trees, unapproachable by the sinful, guarded
by serpents; Mandar, rocky, covered with rank vegetation, infested
by savage beasts. The first is the abode of the gods, the last of
demons. To find the submerged Amrita it was necessary to uproot Mandar
and use it to churn the ocean. This was done by calling on the King
Serpent Ananta, who called in the aid of another great serpent, Vasuki,
the latter being used as a rope coiling and uncoiling to whirl the
mountain. At last the Amrita appeared. But there also streamed forth
from the ocean bed a terrible stench and venom, which was spreading
through the universe when Siva swallowed it to save mankind,--the
drug having stained his throat blue, whence his epithet 'Blue Neck.'

When the Asuras saw the Amrita, they claimed it; but one of the Devas,
Narya, assumed the form of a beautiful woman, and so fascinated them
that they forgot the Amrita for the moment, which the gods drank. One
of the Asuras, however, Rahu, assumed the form of a god or Deva, and
began to drink. The immortalising nectar had not gone farther than
his throat when the sun and moon saw the deceit and discovered it to
Naraya, who cut off Rahu's head. The head of Rahu, being immortal,
bounded to the sky, where its efforts to devour the sun and moon,
which betrayed him, causes their eclipses. The tail (Ketu) also enjoys
immortality in a lower plane, and is the fatal planet which sends
diseases on mankind. A furious war between the gods and the Asuras
has been waged ever since. And since the Devas are the strongest,
it is not wonderful that it should have passed into the folklore
of the whole Aryan world that the evil host are for ever seeking to
recover by cunning the Amrita. The Serpents guarding the paradise of
the Devas have more than once, in a mythologic sense, been induced
to betray their trust and glide into the divine precincts to steal
the coveted draught. This is the Kvasir [30] of the Scandinavian
Mythology, which is the source of that poetic inspiration whose songs
have magical potency. The sacramental symbol of the Amrita in Hindu
Theology is the Soma juice, and this plant Indra is declared in the
Rig-Veda (i. 130) to have discovered "hidden, like the nestlings of
a bird, amidst a pile of rocks enclosed by bushes," where the dragon
Drought had concealed it. Indra, in the shape of a hawk, flew away
with it. In the Prose Edda the Frost Giant Suttung has concealed the
sacred juice, and it is kept by the maid Gunlauth in a cavern overgrown
with bushes. Bragi bored a hole through the rock. [[Odin]] in the shape
of a worm crept through the crevice; then resuming his godlike shape,
charmed the maid into permitting him to drink one draught out of the
three jars; and, having left no drop, in form of an eagle flew to
[[Asgard]], and discharged in the jars the wonder-working liquid. Hence
poetry is called [[Odin]]'s booty, and [[Odin]]'s gift.

Those who attentively compare these myths with the legend in Genesis
will not have any need to rest upon the doubtful etymology of 'Adam'
[31] to establish the Ayran origin of the latter. The Tree of the
knowledge of Good and Evil which made man 'as one of us' (the Elohim)
is the Soma of India, the Haoma of Persia, the kvasir of Scandinavia,
to which are ascribed the intelligence and powers of the gods, and
the ardent thoughts of their worshippers. The Tree of Immortality is
the Amrita, the only monopoly of the gods. 'The Lord God said, Behold
the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest
he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat,
and live for ever: Therefore the Lord God sent him forth the garden
of Eden to till the ground whence he had been taken. So he drove out
the man; and he placed on the east of the garden of Eden cherubim,
and a flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way of the
tree of life.'

This flaming sword turning every way is independent of the cherub,
and takes the place of the serpent which had previously guarded the
Meru paradise, but is now an enemy no longer to be trusted.

If the reader will now re-read the story in Genesis with the old names
restored, he will perceive that there is no puzzle at all in any part
of it:--'Now Rahu [because he had stolen and tasted Soma] was more
subtle than any beast of the field which the Devas had made, and he
said to [[Adea]] Suktee, the first woman, Have the Devas said you shall
not eat of every tree in the garden? And she said unto Rahu, We may
eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden; but of the Soma-plant,
which is in the middle of the garden, the Devas have said we shall
not eat or touch it on pain of death. Then Rahu said to [[Adea]], You
will not suffer death by tasting Soma [I have done so, and live]:
the Devas know that on the day when you taste it your eyes shall be
opened, and you will be equal to them in knowledge of good and evil
... [and you will be able at once to discover which tree it is that
bears the fruit which renders you immortal--the Amrita].... [[Adea]] took
of the Soma and did eat, and gave also unto Adima, her husband, and the
eyes of them both were opened.... And Indra, chief of the Devas, said
to Rahu, Because you have done this, you are cursed above all cattle
and above every beast of the field; [for they shall transmigrate,
their souls ascend through higher forms to be absorbed in the Creative
principle; but] upon thy belly shalt thou go [remaining transfixed in
the form you have assumed to try and obtain the Amrita]; and [instead
of the ambrosia you aimed at] you shall eat dirt through all your
existence.... And Indra said, Adima and [[Adea]] Suktee have [tasted Soma,
and] become as one of us Devas [so far as] to know good and evil;
and now, lest man put forth his hand [on our precious Amrita], and
take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever [giving
us another race of Asuras or Serpent-men to compete with].... Indra
and the Devas drove Adima out of Meru, and placed watch-dogs at the
east of the garden; and [a sinuous darting flame, precisely matched
to the now unchangeable form of Rahu], a flaming sword which turned
every way, to keep the way of the Amrita from Adima and Asuras.'

While the gods and serpents were churning the ocean for the Amrita,
all woes and troubles for mortals came up first. That ocean shrinks
in one region to the box of Pandora, in another to the fruit eaten by
Eve. How foreign such a notion is to the Hebrew theology is shown by
the fact that even while the curses are falling from the fatal fruit
on the earth and man, they are all said to have proceeded solely from
Jehovah, who is thus made to supplement the serpent's work.

It will be seen that in the above version of the story in Genesis I
have left out various passages. These are in part such as must be more
fully treated in the succeeding chapter, and in part the Semitic mosses
which have grown upon the Aryan boulder. But even after the slight
treatment which is all I have space to devote to the comparative
study of the myth in this aspect, it may be safely affirmed that
the problems which we found insoluble by Hebrew correlatives no
longer exist if an Aryan origin be assumed. We know why the fruit
of knowledge was forbidden: because it endangered the further fruit
of immortality. We know how the Serpent might be condemned to crawl
for ever without absurdity: because he was of a serpent-race, able
to assume higher forms, and capable of transmigration, and of final
absorption. We know why the eating of the fruit brought so many woes:
it was followed by the stream of poison from the churned ocean which
accompanied the Amrita, and which would have destroyed the race of both
gods and men, had not Siva drank it up. If anything were required to
make the Aryan origin of the fable certain, it will be found in the
fact which will appear as we go on,--namely, that the rabbins of our
era, in explaining the legend which their fathers severely ignored,
did so by borrowing conceptions foreign to the original ideas of
their race,--notions about human transformation to animal shapes,
and about the Serpent (which Moses honoured), and mainly of a kind
travestying the Iranian folklore. Such contact with foreign races
for the first time gave the Jews any key to the legend which their
patriarchs and prophets were compelled to pass over in silence.







CHAPTER VIII.

EVE.

The Fall of Man--Fall of gods--Giants--Prajapati and Rahu--Woman
and Star-serpent in Persia--Meschia and Meschiane--Brahman
legends of the creation of Man--The strength of Woman--Elohist
and Jehovist creations of Man--The Forbidden Fruit--Eve reappears
as Sara--Abraham surrenders his wife to Jehovah--The idea not
sensual--Abraham's circumcision--The evil name of Woman--Noah's
wife--The temptation of Abraham--Rabbinical legends concerning
Eve--Pandora--Sentiment of the Myth of Eve.


The insignificance of the Serpent of Eden in the scheme and teachings
of the Hebrew Bible is the more remarkable when it is considered that
the pessimistic view of human nature is therein fully represented. In
the story of the Temptation itself, there is, indeed, no such
generalisation as we find in the modern dogma of the Fall of Man;
but the elements of it are present in the early assumption that
the thoughts of man's heart run to evil continually,--which must
be an obvious fact everywhere while goodness is identified with
fictitious merits. There are also expressions suggesting a theory
of heredity, of a highly superstitious character,--the inheritance
being by force of the ancestral word or act, and without reference
to inherent qualities. Outward merits and demerits are transmitted
for reward and punishment to the third and fourth generation; but
the more common-sense view appears to have gradually superseded this,
as expressed in the proverb that the fathers ate sour grapes and the
children's teeth were on edge.

In accounting for this condition of human nature, popular traditions
among the Jews always pointed rather to a fall of the gods than to
any such catastrophe to man. 'The sons of the Elohim (gods) saw the
daughters of men that they were beautiful, and they took to themselves
for wives whomsoever they chose.' 'There were giants in the earth in
those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto
the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became
mighty men, which were of old men of renown.' [32] These giants were
to the Semitic mind what the Ahis, Vritras, Sushnas and other monsters
were to the Aryan, or Titans to the Greek mind. They were not traced
to the Serpent, but to the wild nature-gods, the Elohim, and when
Jehovah appears it is to wage war against them. The strength of this
belief is illustrated in the ample accounts given in the Old Testament
of the Rephaim and their king Og, the Anakim and Goliath, the Emim,
the Zamzummim, and others, all of which gained full representation in
Hebrew folklore. The existence of these hostile beings was explained
by their fall from angelic estate.

The Book of Enoch gives what was no doubt the popular understanding
of the fall of the angels and its results. Two hundred angels took
wives of the daughters of men, and their offspring were giants three
thousand yards in height. These giants having consumed the food
of mankind, began to devour men, whose cries were brought to the
attention of Jehovah by his angels. One [[angel]] was sent to warn Noah
of the Flood; another to bind Azazel in a dark place in the desert
till the Judgment Day; Gabriel was despatched to set the giants to
destroying one another; Michael was sent to bury the fallen angels
under the hills for seventy generations, till the Day of Judgment, when
they should be sent to the fiery abyss for ever. Then every evil work
should come to an end, and the plant of righteousness spring up. [33]

Such exploits and successes on the part of the legal Deity against
outlaws, though they may be pitched high in heroic romance, are
found beside a theology based upon a reverse situation. Nothing is
more fundamental in the ancient Jewish system than the recognition
of an outside world given over to idolatry and wickedness, while
Jews are a small colony of the children of Israel and chosen of
Jehovah. Such a conception in primitive times is so natural, and
possibly may have been so essential to the constitution of nations,
that it is hardly useful to look for parallels. Though nearly all
races see in their traditional dawn an Age of Gold, a Happy Garden,
or some corresponding felicity, these are normally defined against
anterior chaos or surrounding ferocity. Every Eden has had its guards.

When we come to legends which relate particularly to the way in
which the early felicity was lost, many facts offer themselves for
comparative study. And with regard to the myths of Eden and Eve,
we may remark what appears to have been a curious interchange of
legends between the Hebrews and Persians. The ancient doctrines of
India and Persia concerning Origins are largely, if not altogether,
astronomical. In the Genesis of India we see a golden egg floating
on a shoreless ocean; it divides to make the heaven above and earth
beneath; from it emerges Prajapati, who also falls in twain to make
the mortal and immortal substances; the parts of him again divide to
make men and women on earth, sun and moon in the sky. This is but one
version out of many, but all the legends about Prajapati converge
in making him a figure of Indian astronomy. In the Rig-Veda he is
Orion, and for ever lies with the three arrows in his belt which
Sirius shot at him because of his love for Aldebaran,--towards which
constellation he stretches. Now, in a sort of antithesis to this,
the evil Rahu is also cut in twain, his upper and immortal part
pursuing and trying to eclipse the sun and moon, his tail (Ketu)
becoming the 9th planet, shedding evil influences on mankind. [34]
This tail, Ketu, is quite an independent monster, and we meet with
him in the Persian planisphere, where he rules the first of the six
mansions of Ahriman, and is the 'crooked serpent' mentioned in the
Book of Job. By referring to vol. i. p. 253, the reader will see that
this Star-serpent must stand as close to the woman with her child and
sheaf as September stands to October. But unquestionably the woman
was put there for honour and not disgrace; with her child and sheaf
she represented the fruitage of the year.

There is nothing in Persian Mythology going to show that the woman
betrayed her mansion of fruitage--the golden year--to the Serpent
near her feet. In the Bundehesch we have the original man, Kaiomarts,
who is slain by Ahriman as Prajapati (Orion) was by Sirius; from his
dead form came Meschia and Meschiane, the first human pair. Ahriman
corrupts them by first giving them goats' milk, an evil influence
from Capricorn. After they had thus injured themselves he tempted
them with a fruit which robbed them of ninety-nine hundredths
of their happiness. In all this there is no indication that the
woman and man bore different relations to the calamity. But after a
time we find a Parsi postscript to this effect: 'The woman was the
first to sacrifice to the Devas.' This is the one item in the Parsi
Mythology which shows bias against woman, and as it is unsupported
by the narratives preceding it, we may suppose that it was derived
from some foreign country.

That country could hardly have been India. There is a story in remote
districts of India which relates that the first woman was born out
of an expanding lotus on the Ganges, and was there received in his
paradise by the first man (Adima, or Manu). Having partaken of the
Soma, they were expelled, after first being granted their prayer to be
allowed a last draught from the Ganges; the effect of the holy water
being to prevent entire corruption, and secure immortality to their
souls. But nowhere in Indian legend or folklore do we find any special
dishonour put upon woman such as is described in the Hebrew story.

Rather we find the reverse. Early in the last century, a traveller,
John Marshall, related stories of the creation which he says were
told him by the Brahmins, and others 'by the Brahmins of Persia.' [35]

'Once on a time,' the Brahmins said, 'as (God) was set in eternity,
it came into his mind to make something, and immediately no sooner had
he thought the same, but that the same minute was a perfect beautiful
woman present immediately before him, which he called [[Adea]] Suktee,
that is, the first woman. Then this figure put into his mind the
figure of a man; which he had no sooner conceived in his mind, but
that he also started up, and represented himself before him; this he
called Manapuise, that is, the first man; then, upon a reflection of
these things, he resolved further to create several places for them
to abide in, and accordingly, assuming a subtil body, he breathed in
a minute the whole universe, and everything therein, from the least
to the greatest.'

'The Brahmins of Persia tell certain long stories of a great Giant that
was led into a most delicate garden, which, upon certain conditions,
should be his own for ever. But one evening in a cool shade one of
the wicked Devatas, or spirits, came to him, and tempted him with vast
sums of gold, and all the most precious jewels that can be imagined;
but he courageously withstood that temptation, as not knowing what
value or use they were of: but at length this wicked Devata brought
to him a fair woman, who so charmed him that for her sake he most
willingly broke all his conditions, and thereupon was turned out.'

In the first of these two stories the names given to the man and woman
are popular words derived from Sanskrit. In the second the Persian
characters are present, as in the use of Devatas to denote wicked
powers; but for the rest, this latter legend appears to me certainly
borrowed from the Jews so far as the woman is concerned. It was they
who first perceived any connection between Virgo in the sixth mansion
of Ormuzd, and Python in the seventh, and returned the Persians their
planisphere with a new gloss. Having adopted the Dragon's tail (Ketu)
for a little preliminary performance, the Hebrew system dismisses
that star-snake utterly; for it has already evolved a terrestrial
devil from its own inner consciousness.

The name of that devil is--Woman. The diabolisation of woman in their
theology and tradition is not to be regarded as any indication that
the Hebrews anciently held women in dishonour; rather was it a tribute
to her powers of fascination such as the young man wrote to be placed
under the pillow of Darius--'Woman is strongest.' As Darius and his
council agreed that, next to truth, woman is strongest--stronger than
wine or than kings, so do the Hebrew fables testify by interweaving
her beauty and genius with every evil of the world.

Between the Elohist and Jahvist accounts of the creation of man,
there are two differences of great importance. The Elohim are said to
have created man in their own image, male and female,--the word for
'created' being bara, literally meaning to carve out. Jehovah Elohim
is said to have formed man,--nothing being said about his own image,
or about male and female,--the word formed being yatsar'. The sense of
this word yatsar in this place (Gen. ii. 7) must be interpreted by what
follows: Jehovah is said to have formed man out of the aphar', which
the English version translates dust, but the Septuagint more correctly
sperma. The literal meaning is a finely volatilised substance, and in
Numbers xxiii. 10, it is used to represent the seed of Jacob. In the
Jehovistic creation it means that man was formed out of the seminal
principle of the earth combined with the breath of Jehovah; and the
legend closely resembles the account of the ancient Satapatha-Brahmana,
which shows the creative power in sexual union with the fluid world
to produce the egg  from which Prajapati was born, to be divided into
man and woman.

These two accounts, therefore,--to wit, that in the first and that in
the second chapter of Genesis,--must be regarded as being of different
events, and not merely varying myths of the same event. The offspring
of Jehovah were 'living souls,' an expression not used in connection
with the created images of the giants or Elohim. The Elohist pair
roam about the world freely eating all fruits and herbs, possessing
nature generally, and, as male and female, encouraged to increase
and multiply; but Jehovah carefully separates his two children from
general nature, places them in a garden, forbids certain food, and
does not say a word about sex even, much less encourage its functions.

Adam was formed simply to be the gardener of Eden; no other motive
is assigned. In proposing the creation of a being to be his helper
and companion, nothing is said about a new sex,--the word translated
'help-meet' (ezer) is masculine. Adam names the being made 'woman,'
(Vulg. Virago) only because she has been made out of man, but sex
is not even yet suggested. This is so marked that the compiler has
filled up what he considered an omission with (verse 24) a little
lecture on duty to wives.

It is plain that the jealously-guarded ambrosia of Aryan gods has here
been adapted to signify the sexual relation. That is the fruit in the
midst of the garden which is reserved. The eating of it is immediately
associated with consciousness of nudity and shame. The curse upon
Eve is appropriate. Having taken a human husband, she is to be his
slave; she shall bring forth children in sorrow, and many of them
(Gen. iii. 16). Adam is to lose his position in Jehovah's garden,
and to toil in accursed ground, barren and thorny.

Cast out thus into the wilderness, the human progeny as it increased
came in contact with the giant's progeny,--those created by the Elohim
(Gen. i.). When these had intermarried, Jehovah said that the fact
that the human side in such alliance had been originally vitalised
by his breath could not now render it immortal, because 'he (man)
also is flesh,' i.e., like the creatures of the nature-gods. After
two great struggles with these Titans, drowning most of them, hurling
down their tower and scattering them, Jehovah resolved upon a scheme
of vast importance, and one which casts a flood of light upon the
narrative just given. Jehovah's great aim is shown in the Abrahamic
covenant to be to found a family on earth, of which he can say, 'Thou
art my son; I have begotten thee.' Eve was meant to be the mother of
that family, but by yielding to her passion for the man meant only
to be her companion she had thwarted the purpose of Jehovah. But she
reappears again under the name of Sara; and from first to last the
sense of these records, however overlaid by later beliefs, is the
expansion, varying fortunes, and gradual spiritualisation of this
aspiration of a deity for a family of his own in the earth.

Celsus said that the story of the Virgin Mary and the Holy Ghost
is one in which Christians would find little 'mystery' if the names
were Danae and Jupiter. The same may be said of the story of Sara and
Jehovah, of which that concerning Mary is a theological travesty. Sarai
(as she was called before her transfer to Jehovah, who then forbade
Abraham to call her 'My Princess,' but only 'Princess') was chosen
because she was childless. Abraham was paid a large recompense
for her surrender, and provision was made that he should have a
mistress, and by her a son. This natural son was to be renowned
and have great possessions; nominally Abraham was to be represented
by Sara's miraculously-conceived son, and to control his fortunes,
but the blood of the new race was to be purely divine in its origin,
so that every descendant of Isaac might be of Jehovah's family in
Abraham's household.

Abraham twice gave over his wife to different kings who were
jealously punished by Jehovah for sins they only came near committing
unconsciously, while Abraham himself was not even rebuked for the sin
he did commit. The forbidden fruit was not eaten this time; and the
certificate and proof of the supernatural conception of Isaac were
made clear in Sarah's words--'God hath made me to laugh: all that hear
will laugh with me: who would have said unto Abraham that Sarah should
have given children suck? for I have borne a son in his old age.' [36]

It was the passionate nature and beauty of Woman which had thus far
made the difficulty. The forbidden fruit was 'pleasant to the eyes,'
and Eve ate it; and it was her 'voice' to which Adam had hearkened
rather than to that of Jehovah (Gen. iii. 17). And, again, it was
the easy virtue and extreme beauty of Sara (Gen. xii. 11, 14) which
endangered the new scheme. The rabbinical traditions are again on
this point very emphatic. It is related that when Abram came to
the border of Egypt he hid Sara in a chest, and was so taking her
into that country. The collector of customs charged that the chest
contained raiment, silks, gold, pearls, and Abram paid for all these;
but this only increased the official's suspicions, and he compelled
Abram to open the chest; when this was done and Sara rose up, the
whole land of Egypt was illumined by her splendour. [37]

There is no reason for supposing that the ideas underlying the
relation which Jehovah meant to establish with Eve, and succeeded in
establishing with Sara, were of a merely sensual description. These
myths belong to the mental region of ancestor-worship, and the
fundamental conception is that of founding a family to reign over all
other families. Jehovah's interest is in Isaac rather than Sara, who,
after she has borne that patriarch, lapses out of the story almost
as completely as Eve. The idea is not, indeed, so theological as it
became in the Judaic-christian legend of the conception of Jesus
by Mary as spouse of the Deity; it was probably, however, largely
ethnical in the case of Eve, and national in that of Sara.

It being considered of the utmost importance that all who claimed the
advantages in the Jewish commonwealth accruing only to the legal,
though nominal, 'children of Abraham,' should really be of divine
lineage, security must be had against Isaac having any full brother. It
might be that in after time some natural son of Sara might claim
to be the one born of divine parentage, might carry on the Jewish
commonwealth, slay the children of Jehovah by Sara, and so end the
divine lineage with the authority it carried. Careful precautions
having been taken that Ishmael should be an 'irreconcilable,'
there is reason to suspect that the position of Isaac as Jehovah's
'only-begotten son' was secured by means obscurely hinted in the
circumcision first undergone by Abraham, and made the sign of the
covenant. That circumcision, wheresoever it has survived, is the
relic of a more horrible practice of barbarian asceticism, is hardly
doubtful; that the original rite was believed to have been that by
which Abraham fulfilled his contract with Jehovah, appears to me
intimated in various passages of the narrative which have survived
editorial arrangement in accordance with another view. For instance,
the vast inducements offered Abraham, and the great horror that fell
on the patriarch, appear hardly explicable on the theory that nothing
was conceded on Abraham's side beyond the surrender of a wife whom
he had freely consigned to earthly monarchs.

Though the suspicion just expressed as to the nature of Abraham's
circumcision may be doubted, it is not questionable that the rite of
circumcision bears a significance in rabbinical traditions and Jewish
usages which renders its initiation by Abraham at least a symbol of
marital renunciation. Thus, the custom of placing in a room where
the rite of circumcision was performed a pot of dust, was explained
by the rabbins to have reference to the dust which Jehovah declared
should be the serpent's food. [38] That circumcision should have been
traditionally associated with the temptation of Eve is a confirmation
of the interpretation which regards her (Eve) as the prototype of
Sara and the serpent as sexual desire.

Although, if the original sense of Abraham's circumcision were what
has been suggested, it had been overlaid, when the Book of Genesis
in its present form was compiled, by different traditions, and that
patriarch is described as having married again and had other children,
the superior sanctity of Sara's son was preserved. Indeed, there would
seem to have continued for a long time a tradition that the Abrahamic
line and covenant were to be carried out by 'the seed of the woman'
alone, and the paternity of Jehovah. Like Sara, Rebekah is sterile, and
after her Rachel; the birth of Jacob and Esau from one, and of Joseph
and Benjamin from the other, being through the intervention of Jehovah.

The great power of woman for good or evil, and the fact that it has
often been exercised with subtlety--the natural weapon of the weak in
dealing with the strong--are remarkably illustrated in the legends of
these female figures which appear in connection with the divine schemes
in the Book of Genesis. But even more the perils of woman's beauty
are illustrated, especially in Eve and Sara. There were particular and
obvious reasons why these representative women could not be degraded or
diabolised in their own names or history, even where their fascinations
tended to countervail the plans of Jehovah. The readiness with which
Sara promoted her husband's prostitution and consented to her own,
the treachery of Rebekah to her son Esau, could yet not induce Jewish
orthodoxy to give evil names to the Madonnas of their race; but the
inference made was expressed under other forms and names. It became
a settled superstition that wherever evil was going on, Woman was at
the bottom of it. Potiphar's wife, Jezebel, Vashti, and Delilah, were
among the many she-scape-goats on whom were laid the offences of their
august official predecessors who 'could do no wrong.' Even after Satan
has come upon the scene, and is engaged in tempting Job, it seems to
have been thought essential to the task that he should have an agent
beside the troubled man in the wife who bade him 'curse God and die.'

It is impossible to say at just what period the rabbins made their
ingenious discovery that the devil and Woman entered the world at
the same time,--he coming out of the hole left by removal of the
rib from Adam before it was closed. This they found disclosed in the
fact that it is in Genesis iii. 21, describing the creation of Woman,
that there appears for the first time Samech--the serpent-letter S
(in Vajisgor). [39] But there were among them many legends of a
similar kind that leave one no wonder concerning the existence of
a thanksgiving taught boys that they have not been created women,
however much one may be scandalised at its continuance in the present
day. It was only in pursuance of this theory of Woman that there was
developed at a later day a female assistant of the Devil in another
design to foil the plans of Jehovah, from the Scriptual narrative of
which the female role is omitted. In the Scriptural legend of Noah
his wife is barely mentioned, and her name is not given, but from an
early period vague rumours to her discredit floated about, and these
gathered consistency in the Gnostic legend that it was through her
that Satan managed to get on board the Ark, as is elsewhere related
(Part IV. chap. xxvii.), and was so enabled to resuscitate antediluvial
violence in the drunken curses of Noah. Satan did this by working
upon both the curiosity and jealousy of Noraita, the name assigned
Noah's wife.

It has been necessary to give at length the comparative view of the
myth of Eden in order that the reader may estimate the grounds upon
which rests a theory which has been submitted after much hesitation
concerning its sense. The 'phallic' theory by which it has become
the fashion to interpret so many of these old fables, appears
to me to have been done to death; yet I cannot come to any other
conclusion concerning the legend of Eve than that she represents
that passional nature of Woman which, before it was brought under
such rigid restraint, might easily be regarded as a weakness to any
tribe desirous of keeping itself separate from other tribes. The
oath exacted by Abraham of his servant that he should seek out a
wife from among his own people, and not among Canaanitish women,
is one example among many of this feeling, which, indeed, survives
among Jews at the present day. Such a sentiment might underlie the
stories of Eve and Sara--the one mingling the blood of the family
of Jehovah with mere human flesh, the other nearly confusing it
with aliens. As the idea of tribal sanctity and separateness became
strengthened by the further development of theocratic government,
such myths would take on forms representing Jehovah's jealousy in
defending his family line against the evil powers which sought to
confuse or destroy it. One such attempt appears to underlie the story
of the proposed sacrifice of Isaac. Although the account we have of
that proceeding in the Bible was written at a time when the Elohist
and Jahvist parties had compromised their rivalries to some extent,
and suggests the idea that Jehovah himself ordered the sacrifice in
order to try the faith of Abraham, enough of the primitive tradition
lingers in the narrative to make it probable that its original intent
was to relate how one of the superseded Elohim endeavoured to tempt
Abraham to sacrifice Sara's only son, and so subvert the aim of Jehovah
to perpetuate his seed. The God who 'tempted Abraham' is throughout
sharply distinguished from the Jehovah who sent his [[angel]] to prevent
the sacrifice and substitute an animal victim for Isaac.

Although, as we have seen, Sara was spared degradation into a she-devil
in subsequent myths, because her body was preserved intact despite her
laxity of mind, such was not the case with Eve. The silence concerning
her preserved throughout the Bible after her fall is told was broken
by the ancient rabbins, and there arose multitudinous legends in
which her intimacies with devils are circumstantially reported. Her
first child, Cain, was generally believed to be the son of one of the
devils (Samael) that consorted with her, and the world was said to be
peopled with gnomes and demons which she brought forth during that
130 years at the end of which it is stated that Adam begot a son in
his own image and likeness, and called his name Seth (Gen. v. 3). The
previous children were supposed to be not in purely human form, and
not to have been of Adam's paternity. Adam had during that time refused
to have any children, knowing that he would only rear inmates of hell.

The legend of Eden has gone round the world doing various duty,
but nearly always associated with the introduction of moral evil
into the world. In the Lateran Museum at Rome there is a remarkable
bas-relief representing a nude man and woman offering sacrifice before
a serpent coiled around a tree, while an [[angel]] overthrows the altar
with his foot. This was probably designed as a fling at the Ophites,
and is very interesting as a survival from the ancient Aryan meaning
of the Serpent. But since the adaptation of the myth by the Semitic
race, it has generally emphasised the Tree of the Knowledge of Good
and Evil, instead of the Tree of Immortality (Amrita), which is the
chief point of interest in the Aryan myth. There are indeed traces of
a conflict with knowledge and scepticism in it which we shall have
to consider hereafter. The main popular association with it, the
introduction into the world of all the ills that flesh is heir to,
is perfectly consistent with the sense which has been attributed to
its early Hebrew form; for this includes the longing for maternity,
its temptations and its pains, and the sorrows and sins which are
obviously traceable to it.

Some years ago, when the spectacular drama of 'Paradise' was performed
in Paris, the Temptation was effected by means of a mirror. Satan
glided behind the tree as a serpent, and then came forth as a
handsome man, and after uttering compliments that she could not
understand, presented Eve with a small oval mirror which explained them
all. Mlle. [[Abingdon]] as Eve displayed consummate art in her expression
of awakening self-admiration, of the longing for admiration from the
man before her, and the various stages of self-consciousness by which
she is brought under the Tempter's power. This idea of the mirror
was no doubt borrowed from the corresponding fable of Pandora. On
a vase (Etruscan) in the Hamilton Collection there is an admirable
representation of Pandora opening her box, from which all evils are
escaping. She is seated beneath a tree, around which a serpent is
coiled. Among the things which have come out of the box is this same
small oval mirror. In this variant, Hope, coming out last corresponds
with the prophecy that the seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's
head. The ancient Etruscan and the modern Parisian version are both
by the mirror finely connected with the sexual sense of the legend.

The theological interpretation of the beautiful myth of Eden
represents a sort of spiritual vivisection; yet even as a dogma the
story preserves high testimony: when woman falls the human race falls
with her; when man rises above his inward or outward degradations
and recovers his Paradise, it is because his nature is refined by
the purity of woman, and his home sweetened by her heart. There is a
widespread superstition that every Serpent will single out a woman
from any number of people for its attack. In such dim way is felt
her gentle bruising of man's reptilian self. No wonder that woman is
excluded from those regions of life where man's policy is still to
crawl, eat dust, and bite the heel.

It is, I suppose, the old Mystery of the Creation which left Coventry
its legend of a Good Eve (Godiva, whose name is written 'good Eve'
in a Conventry verse, 1494), whose nakedness should bring benefit to
man, as that of the first Eve brought him evil. The fig-leaf of Eve,
gathered no doubt from the tree whose forbidden fruit she had eaten,
has gradually grown so large as to cloak her mind and spirit as well
as her form. Her work must still be chiefly that of a spirit veiled
and ashamed. Her passions suppressed, her genius disbelieved, her
influence forced to seek hidden and often illegitimate channels,
Woman now outwardly represents a creation of man to suit his own
convenience. But the Serpent has also changed a great deal since
the days of Eve, and now, as Intelligence, has found out man in his
fool's-paradise, where he stolidly maintains that, with few exceptions,
it is good for man to be alone. But good women are remembering Godiva;
and realising that, the charms which have sometimes lowered man or
cost him dear may be made his salvation. It shall be so when Woman
can face with clear-eyed purity all the facts of nature, can cast
away the mental and moral swathing-clothes transmitted from Eden,
and put forth all her powers for the welfare of mankind,--a Good Eva,
whom Coventry Toms may call naked, but who is 'not ashamed' of the
garb of Innocence and Truth.







CHAPTER IX.

LILITH.

Madonnas--Adam's first wife--Her flight and doom--Creation of
devils--Lilith marries Samael--Tree of Life--Lilith's part
in the Temptation--Her locks--Lamia--Bodeima--Meschia and
Meschiane--Amazons--Maternity--Rib-theory of Woman--Kali and
Durga--Captivity of Woman.


The attempt of the compilers of the Book of Genesis to amalgamate
the Elohist and Jehovist legends, ignoring the moral abyss that yawns
between them, led to some sufficiently curious results. One of these
it may be well enough to examine here, since, though later in form
than some other legends which remain to be considered, it is closely
connected in spirit with the ancient myth of Eden and illustrative
of it.

The differences between the two creations of man and woman critically
examined in the previous chapter were fully recognised by the ancient
rabbins, and their speculations on the subject laid the basis for
the further legend that the woman created (Gen. i.) at the same time
with Adam, and therefore not possibly the woman formed from his rib,
was a first wife who turned out badly.

To this first wife of Adam it was but natural to assign the name
of one of the many ancient goddesses who had been degraded into
demonesses. For the history of Mariolatry in the North of Europe has
been many times anticipated: the mother's tenderness and self-devotion,
the first smile of love upon social chaos, availed to give every race
its Madonna, whose popularity drew around her the fatal favours of
priestcraft, weighing her down at last to be a type of corruption. Even
the Semitic tribes, with their hard masculine deities, seem to have
once worshipped Alilat, whose name survives in Elohim and Allah. Among
these degraded Madonnas was Lilith, whose name has been found in a
Chaldean inscription, which says, when a country is at peace 'Lilith
(Lilatu) is not before them.' The name is from Assyr. lay'la, Hebrew
Lil (night), which already in Accadian meant 'sorcery.' It probably
personified, at first, the darkness that soothed children to slumber;
and though the word Lullaby has, with more ingenuity than accuracy,
been derived from Lilith Abi, the theory may suggest the path by
which the soft Southern night came to mean a nocturnal spectre.

The only place where the name of Lilith occurs in the Bible is
Isa. xxxiv. 14, where the English version renders it 'screech-owl.' In
the Vulgate it is translated 'Lamia,' and in Luther's Bible, 'Kobold;'
Gesenius explains it as 'nocturna, night-spectre, ghost.'

The rabbinical myths concerning Lilith, often passed over as puerile
fancies, appear to me pregnant with significance and beauty. Thus
Abraham Ecchelensis, giving a poor Arabic version of the legend, says,
'This fable has been transmitted to the Arabs from Jewish sources
by some converts of Mahomet from Cabbalism and Rabbinism, who have
transferred all the Jewish fooleries to the Arabs.' [40] But the
rabbinical legend grew very slowly, and relates to principles and facts
of social evolution whose force and meaning are not yet exhausted.

Premising that the legend is here pieced together mainly from
Eisenmenger, [41] who at each mention of the subject gives ample
references to rabbinical authorities, I will relate it without further
references of my own.

Lilith was said to have been created at the same time and in the same
way as Adam; and when the two met they instantly quarrelled about
the headship which both claimed. Adam began the first conversation
by asserting that he was to be her master. Lilith replied that she
had equal right to be chief. Adam insisting, Lilith uttered a certain
spell called Schem-hammphorasch--afterwards confided by a fallen [[angel]]
to one of 'the daughters of men' with whom he had an intrigue, and of
famous potency in Jewish folklore--the result of which was that she
obtained wings. Lilith then flew out of Eden and out of sight. [42]
Adam then cried in distress--'Master of the world, the woman whom thou
didst give me has flown away.' The Creator then sent three angels to
find Lilith and persuade her to return to the garden; but she declared
that it could be no paradise to her if she was to be the servant of
man. She remained hovering over the Red Sea, where the angels had
found her, while these returned with her inflexible resolution. And
she would not yield even after the angels had been sent again to
convey to her, as the alternative of not returning, the doom that
she should bear many children but these should all die in infancy.

This penalty was so awful that Lilith was about to commit suicide
by drowning herself in the sea, when the three angels, moved by her
anguish, agreed that she should have the compensation of possessing
full power over all children after birth up to their eighth day; on
which she promised that she would never disturb any babes who were
under their (the angels') protection. Hence the charm (Camea) against
Lilith hung round the necks of Jewish children bore the names of these
three angels--Senoi, Sansenoi, and Sammangelof. Lilith has special
power over all children born out of wedlock for whom she watches,
dressed in finest raiment; and she has especial power on the first
day of the month, and on the Sabbath evening. When a little child
laughs in its sleep it was believed that Lilith was with it, and the
babe must be struck on the nose three times, the words being thrice
repeated--'Away, cursed Lilith! thou hast no place here!'

The divorce between Lilith and Adam being complete, the second Eve
(i.e., Mother) was now formed, and this time out of Adam's rib in
order that there might be no question of her dependence, and that the
embarrassing question of woman's rights might never be raised again.

But about this time the Devils were also created. These beings were
the last of the six days' creation, but they were made so late in
the day that there was no daylight by which to fashion bodies for
them. The Creator was just putting them off with a promise that he
would make them bodies next day, when lo! the Sabbath--which was
for a long time personified--came and sat before him, to represent
the many evils which might result from the precedent he would set
by working even a little on the day whose sanctity had already been
promulgated. Under these circumstances the Creator told the Devils
that they must disperse and try to get bodies as they could find
them. On this account they have been compelled ever since to seek
carnal enjoyments by nestling in the hearts of human beings and
availing themselves of human senses and passions.

These Devils as created were ethereal spirits; they had certain
atmospheric forms, but felt that they had been badly treated in not
having been provided with flesh and blood, and they were envious
of the carnal pleasures which human beings could enjoy. So long as
man and woman remained pure, the Devils could not take possession of
their bodies and enjoy such pleasures, and it was therefore of great
importance to them that the first human pair should be corrupted. At
the head of these Devils stood now a fallen [[angel]]--Samael. Of this
archfiend more is said elsewhere; at this point it need only be said
that he had been an ideal flaming Serpent, leader of the Seraphim. He
was already burning with lust and envy, as he witnessed the pleasures
of Adam and Eve in Eden, when he found beautiful Lilith lamenting
her wrongs in loneliness.

She became his wife. The name of Samael by one interpretation signifies
'the Left'; and we may suppose that Lilith found him radical on
the question of female equality which she had raised in Eden. He
gave her a splendid kingdom where she was attended by 480 troops;
but all this could not compensate her for the loss of Eden,--she
seems never to have regretted parting with Adam,--and for the loss
of her children. She remained the Lady of Sorrow. Her great enemy was
Machalath who presided over 478 troops, and who was for ever dancing,
as Lilith was for ever sighing and weeping. It was long believed that
at certain times the voice of Lilith's grief could be heard in the air.

Samael found in Lilith a willing conspirator against Jehovah in
his plans for man and woman. The corruption of these two meant, to
the troops of Samael, bringing their bodies down into a plane where
they might be entered by themselves (the Devils), not to mention at
present the manifold other motives by which they were actuated. It
may be remarked also that in the rabbinical traditions, after their
Aryan impregnation, there are traces of a desire of the Devils to
reach the Tree of Life.

Truly a wondrous Tree! Around it, in its place at the east of
Eden, sang six hundred thousand lovely angels with happy hymns,
and it glorified the vast garden. It possessed five hundred thousand
different flavours and odours, which were wafted to the four sides
of the world by zephyrs from seven lustrous clouds that made its
canopy. Beneath it sat the disciples of Wisdom on resplendent seats,
screened from the blaze of sun, moon, and cloud-veiled from potency
of the stars (there was no night); and within were the joys referred
to in the verse (Prov. viii. 21), 'That I may cause those that love
me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.'

Had there been an order of female rabbins the story of Lilith might
have borne obvious modifications, and she might have appeared as
a heroine anxious to rescue her sex from slavery to man. As it is
the immemorial prerogative of man to lay all blame upon woman, that
being part of the hereditary following of Adam, it is not wonderful
that Lilith was in due time made responsible for the temptation of
Eve. She was supposed to have beguiled the Serpent on guard at the
gate of Eden to lend her his form for a time, after which theory the
curse on the serpent might mean the binding of Lilith for ever in
that form. This would appear to have originated the notion mentioned
in Comestor (Hist. Schol., 12th cent.), that while the serpent was
yet erect it had a virgin's head. The accompanying example is from a
very early missal in the possession of Sir Joseph Hooker, of which I
could not discover the date or history, but the theory is traceable
in the eighth century. In this picture we have an early example of
those which have since become familiar in old Bibles. Pietro d'Orvieto
painted this serpent-woman in his finest fresco, at Pisa. Perhaps in
no other picture has the genius of Michael Angelo been more felicitous
than in that on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, in which Lilith is
portrayed. In this picture (Fig. 2) the marvellous beauty of his first
wife appears to have awakened the enthusiasm of Adam; and, indeed,
it is quite in harmony with the earlier myth that Lilith should be
of greater beauty than Eve.

An artist and poet of our own time (Rossetti) has by both of his arts
celebrated the fatal beauty of Lilith. His Lilith, bringing 'soft
sleep,' antedates, as I think, the fair devil of the Rabbins, but is
also the mediaeval witch against whose beautiful locks Mephistopheles
warns Faust when she appears at the Walpurgis-night orgie.


        The rose and poppy are her flowers; for where
        Is he not found, O Lilith, whom shed scent
        And soft-shed kisses and soft sleep shall snare?
        Lo! as that youth's eyes burned at thine, so went
        Thy spell through him, and left his straight neck bent,
        And round his heart one strangling golden hair.


The potency of Lilith's tresses has probably its origin in the hairy
nature ascribed by the Rabbins to all demons (shedim), and found
fully represented in Esau. Perhaps the serpent-locks of Medusa had a
similar origin. Nay, there is a suggestion in Dante that these tresses
of Medusa may have once represented fascinating rather than horrible
serpents. As she approaches, Virgil is alarmed for his brother-poet:


        'Turn thyself back, and keep thy vision hid;
        For, if the Gorgon show, and then behold,
        'Twould all be o'er with e'er returning up.'
        So did the master say; and he himself
        Turned me, and to my own hands trusted not,
        But that with his too he should cover me.
        O you that have a sane intelligence,
        Look ye unto the doctrine which herein
        Conceals itself 'neath the strange verses' veil. [43]


If this means that the security against evil is to veil the eyes from
it, Virgil's warning would be against a beautiful seducer, similar to
the warning given by Mephistopheles to Faust against the fatal charms
of Lilith. Since, however, even in the time of Homer, the Gorgon was
a popular symbol of terrors, the possibility of a survival in Dante's
mind of any more primitive association with Medusa is questionable. The
Pauline doctrine, that the glory of a woman is her hair, no doubt had
important antecedents: such glory might easily be degraded, and every
hair turn to a fatal 'binder,' like the one golden thread of Lilith
round the heart of her victim; or it might ensnare its owner. In
Treves Cathedral there is a curious old picture of a woman carried
to hell by her beautiful hair; one devil draws her by it, another is
seated on her back and drives her by locks of it as a bridle.

In the later developments of the myth of Lilith she was, among
the Arabs, transformed to a Ghoul, but in rabbinical legend she
appears to have been influenced by the story of Lamia, whose name is
substituted for Lilith in the Vulgate. Like Lilith, Lamia was robbed
of her children, and was driven by despair to avenge herself on all
children. [44] The name of Lamia was long used to frighten Italian
children, as that of Lilith was by Hebrew nurses.

It is possible that the part assigned to Lilith in the temptation
of Eve may have been suggested by ancient Egyptian sculptures,
which represent the Tree of Life in Amenti (Paradise) guarded by the
Serpent-goddess Nu. One of these in the British Museum represents
the Osirian on his journey to heaven, and his soul in form of a
human-headed bird, drinking the water of Life as poured out to them
from a jar by the goddess who coils around the sacred sycamore, her
woman's bust and face appearing amid the branches much like Lilith
in our old pictures.

The Singhalese also have a kind of Lilith or Lamia whom they call
Bodrima, though she is not so much dreaded for the sake of children as
for her vindictive feelings towards men. She is the ghost of a woman
who died in childbirth and in great agony. She may be heard wailing
in the night, it is said, and if she meets any man will choke him
to death. When her wailing is heard men are careful to stay within
doors, but the women go forth with brooms in their hands and abuse
Bodrima with epithets. She fears women, especially when they carry
brooms. But the women have also some compassion for this poor ghost,
and often leave a lamp and some betel leaves where she may get some
warmth and comfort from them. If Bodrima be fired at, there may be
found, perhaps, a dead lizard near the spot in the morning.

As protomartyr of female independence, Lilith suffered a fate not
unlike that of her sisters and successors in our own time who have
appealed from the legendary decision made in Eden: she became the
prototype of the 'strong-minded' and 'cold-hearted' woman, and
personification of the fatal fascination of the passionless. Her
special relation to children was gradually expanded, and she was
regarded as the perilous seducer of young men, each of her victims
perishing of unrequited passion. She was ever young, and always dressed
with great beauty. It would seem that the curse upon her for forsaking
Adam--that her children should die in infancy--was escaped in the
case of the children she had by Samael. She was almost as prolific as
Echidna. Through all the latter rabbinical lore it is repeated, 'Samael
is the fiery serpent, Lilith the crooked serpent,' and from their
union came Leviathan, Asmodeus, and indeed most of the famous devils.

There is an ancient Persian legend of the first man and woman, Meschia
and Meschiane, that they for a long time lived happily together:
they hunted together, and discovered fire, and made an axe, and with
it built them a hut. But no sooner had they thus set up housekeeping
than they fought terribly, and, after wounding each other, parted. It
is not said which remained ruler of the hut, but we learn that after
fifty years of divorce they were reunited.

These legends show the question of equality of the sexes to have
been a very serious one in early times. The story of Meschia and
Meschiane fairly represents primitive man living by the hunt; that
of Eden shows man entering on the work of agriculture. In neither
of these occupations would there be any reason why woman should be
so unequal as to set in motion the forces which have diminished her
physical stature and degraded her position. Women can still hunt and
fish, and they are quite man's equal in tilling the soil. [45]

In all sex-mythology there are intimations that women were taken
captive. The proclamation of female subordination is made not only in
the legend of Eve's creation out of the man's rib, but in the emphasis
with which her name is declared to have been given her because she
was the Mother of all living. In the variously significant legends
of the Amazons they are said to have burned away their breasts that
they might use the bow: in the history of contemporary Amazons--such
as the female Areoi of Polynesia--the legend is interpreted in the
systematic slaughter of their children. In the hunt, Meschia might be
aided by Meschiane in many ways; in dressing the garden Adam might find
Lilith or Eve a 'help meet' for the work; but in the brutal regime of
war the child disables woman, and the affections of maternity render
her man's inferior in the work of butchery. Herakles wins great glory
by slaying Hyppolite; but the legends of her later reappearances--as
Libussa at Prague, &c.,--follow the less mythological story of the
Amazons given by Herodotus (IV. 112), who represents the Scythians
as gradually disarming them by sending out their youths to meet them
with dalliance instead of with weapons. The youths went off with
their captured captors, and from their union sprang the Sauromatae,
among whom the men and women dressed alike, and fought and hunted
together. But of the real outcome of that truce and union Tennyson
can tell us more than Herodotus: in his Princess we see the woman
whom maternity and war have combined to produce, her independence
betrayed by the tenderness of her nature. The surrender, once secured,
was made permanent for ages by the sentiments and sympathies born of
the child's appeal for compassion.

In primitive ages the child must in many cases have been a burthen
even to man in the struggle for existence; the population question
could hardly have failed to press its importance upon men, as it does
even upon certain animals; and it would be an especial interest to a
man not to have his hut overrun with offspring not his own,--turning
his fair labour into drudgery for their support, and so cursing the
earth for him. Thus, while Polyandry was giving rise to the obvious
complications under which it must ultimately disappear, it would be
natural that devils of lust should be invented to restrain the maternal
instinct. But as time went on the daughters of Eve would have taken
the story of her fall and hardships too much to heart. The pangs and
perils of childbirth were ever-present monitors whose warnings might
be followed too closely. The early Jewish laws bear distinct traces
of the necessity which had arrived for insisting on the command to
increase and multiply. Under these changed circumstances it would
be natural that the story of a recusant and passionless Eve should
arise and suffer the penalties undergone by Lilith,--the necessity
of bearing, as captive, a vast progeny against her will only to lose
them again, and to long for human children she did not bring forth
and could not cherish. The too passionate and the passionless woman
are successively warned in the origin and outcome of the myth. [46]

It is a suggestive fact that the descendants of Adam should trace their
fall not to the independent Lilith, who asserted her equality at cost
of becoming the Devil's bride, but to the apparently submissive Eve
who stayed inside the garden. The serpent found out the guarded and
restrained woman as well as the free and defiant, and with much more
formidable results. For craft is the only weapon of the weak against
the strong. The submissiveness of the captive woman must have been
for a long time outward only. When Adam found himself among thorns
and briars he might have questioned whether much had been gained
by calling Eve his rib, when after all she really was a woman, and
prepared to take her intellectual rights from the Serpent if denied
her in legitimate ways. The question is, indeed, hardly out of date
yet when the genius of woman is compelled to act with subtlety and
reduced to exert its influence too often by intrigue.

It is remarkable that we find something like a similar development to
the two wives of Adam in Hindu mythology also. Kali and Durga have the
same origin: the former is represented dancing on the prostrate form
of her 'lord and master,' and she becomes the demoness of violence,
the mother of the diabolical 'Calas' of Singhalese demonolatry. Durga
sacrificed herself for her husband's honour, and is now adored. The
counterpart of Durga-worship is the Zenana system. In countries where
the Zenana system has not survived, but some freedom has been gained
for woman, it is probable that Kali will presently not be thought of
as necessarily trampling on man, and Lilith not be regarded as the
Devil's wife because she will not submit to be the slave of man. When
man can make him a home and garden which shall not be a prison, and in
which knowledge is unforbidden fruit, Lilith will not have to seek her
liberty by revolution against his society, nor Eve hers by intrigue;
unfitness for co-operation with the ferocities of nature will leave
her a help meet for the rearing of children, and for the recovery
and culture of every garden, whether within or without the man who
now asserts over woman a lordship unnatural and unjust.







CHAPTER X.

WAR IN HEAVEN.

The 'Other'--Tiamat, Bohu, 'the Deep'--Ra and Apophis--Hathors--
Bel's combat--Revolt in Heaven--Lilith--Myth of the Devil at the
creation of Light.


In none of the ancient scriptures do we get back to any theory or
explanation of the origin of evil or of the enemies of the gods. In
a Persian text at Persepolis, of Darius I., Ahriman is called with
simplicity 'the Other' (Aniya), and 'the Hater' (Duvaisant, Zend
thaisat), and that is about as much as we are really told about the
devils of any race. Their existence is taken for granted. The legends
of rebellion in heaven and of angels cast down and transformed to
devils may supply an easy explanation to our modern theologians, but
when we trace them to their origin we discover that to the ancients
they had no such significance. The angels were cast down to Pits
prepared for them from the foundation of the world, and before it, and
when they fell it was into the hands of already existing enemies eager
to torment them. Nevertheless these accounts of rebellious spirits
in heaven are of great importance and merit our careful consideration.

It is remarkable that the Bible opens with an intimation of the
existence of this 'Other.' Its second verse speaks of a certain
'darkness upon the face of the deep.' The word used here is Bohu,
which is identified as the Assyrian Bahu, the Queen of Hades. In the
inscription of Shalmaneser the word is used for 'abyss of chaos.' [47]
Bahu is otherwise Gula, a form of Ishtar or Allat, 'Lady of the House
of Death,' and an epithet of the same female demon is Nin-cigal,
'Lady of the Mighty Earth.' The story of the Descent of Ishtar into
Hades, the realm of Nin-cigal, has already been told (p. 77); in
that version Ishtar is the same as Astarte, the Assyrian Venus. But
like the moon with which she was associated she waned and declined,
and the beautiful legend of her descent (like Persephone) into Hades
seems to have found a variant in the myth of Bel and the Dragon. There
she is a sea-monster and is called Tiamat (Thalatth of Berosus),--that
is, 'the Deep,' over which rests the darkness described in Genesis
i. 2. The process by which the moon would share the evil repute of
Tiamat is obvious. In the Babylonian belief the dry land rested upon
the abyss of watery chaos from which it was drawn. This underworld
ocean was shut in by gates. They were opened when the moon was created
to rule the night--therefore Prince of Darkness. The formation by Anu
of this Moon-god (Uru) from Tiamat, might even have been suggested
by the rising of the tides under his sway. The Babylonians represent
the Moon as having been created before the Sun, and he emerged from
'a boiling' in the abyss. 'At the beginning of the month, at the rising
of the night, his horns are breaking through to shine on heaven.' [48]
In the one Babylonian design, a seal in the British Museum, [49] which
seems referable to the legend of the Fall of Man, the male figure
has horns. It may have been that this male Moon (Uru) was supposed
to have been corrupted by some female emanation of Tiamat, and to
have fallen from a 'ruler of the night' to an ally of the night. This
female corrupter, who would correspond to Eve, might in this way have
become mistress of the Moon, and ultimately identified with it.

Although the cause of the original conflict between the Abyss
beneath and the Heaven above is left by ancient inscriptions and
scriptures to imagination, it is not a very strained hypothesis that
ancient Chaos regarded the upper gods as aggressors on her domain
in the work of creation. 'When above,' runs the Babylonian legend,
'were not raised the heavens, and below on the earth a plant had not
grown ... the chaos (or water) Tiamat was the producing mother of the
whole of them.' 'The gods had not sprung up, any one of them.' [50]
Indeed in the legend of the conflict between Bel and the Dragon,
on the Babylonian cylinders, it appears that the god Sar addressed
her as wife, and said, 'The tribute to thy maternity shall be forced
upon them by thy weapons.' [51] The Sun and Moon would naturally be
drawn into any contest between Overworld (with Light) and Underworld
(with Darkness).

Though Tiamat is called a Dragon, she was pictured by the Babylonians
only as a monstrous Griffin. In the Assyrian account of the fight
it will be seen that she is called a 'Serpent.' The link between
the two--Griffin and Serpent--will be found, I suspect, in Typhonic
influence on the fable. In a hymn to Amen-Ra (the Sun), copied about
fourteenth century b.c. from an earlier composition, as its translator,
Mr. Goodwin, supposes, we have the following:--


    The gods rejoice in his goodness who exalts those who are lowly:
    Lord of the boat and barge,
    They conduct thee through the firmament in peace.
      Thy servants rejoice:
    Beholding the overthrow of the wicked:
    His limbs pierced with the sword:
    Fire consumes him:
    His soul and body are annihilated.
      Naka (the serpent) saves his feet:
    The gods rejoice:
    The servants of the Sun are in peace.


The allusion in the second line indicates that this hymn relates to
the navigation of Ra through Hades, and the destruction of Apophis.

We may read next the Accadian tablet (p. 256) which speaks of the
seven Hathors as neither male nor female, and as born in 'the Deep.'

Another Accadian tablet, translated by Mr. Sayce, speaks of these
as the 'baleful seven destroyers;' as 'born in the mountain of the
sunset;' as being Incubi. It is significantly said:--'Among the
stars of heaven their watch they kept not, in watching was their
office.' Here is a primaeval note of treachery. [52]

We next come to a further phase, represented in a Cuneiform tablet,
which must be quoted at length:--


    Days of storm, Powers of Evil,
    Rebellious spirits, who were born in the lower part of heaven,
    They were workers of calamity.


(The lines giving the names and descriptions of the spirits are
here broken.)


    The third was like a leopard,
    The fourth was like a snake ...
    The fifth was like a dog ...
    The sixth was an enemy to heaven and its king.
    The seventh was a destructive tempest.
    These seven are the messengers of Anu [53] their king.
    From place to place by turns they pass.
    They are the dark storms in heaven, which into fire unite
    themselves.
    They are the destructive tempests, which on a fine day sudden
    darkness cause.
    With storms and meteors they rush.
    Their rage ignites the thunderbolts of Im. [54]
    From the right hand of the Thunderer they dart forth.
    On the horizon of heaven like lightning they ...
    Against high heaven, the dwelling-place of Anu the king, they
    plotted evil, and had none to withstand them.
    When Bel heard this news, he communed secretly with his own heart.
    Then he took counsel with Hea the great Inventor (or Sage) of the
    gods.
    And they stationed the Moon, the Sun, and Ishtar to keep guard over
    the approach to heaven.
    Unto Anu, ruler of heaven, they told it.
    And those three gods, his children,
    To watch night and day unceasingly he commanded them.
    When those seven evil spirits rushed upon the base of heaven,
    And close in front of the Moon with fiery weapons advanced,
    Then the noble Sun and Im the warrior side by side stood firm.
    But Ishtar, with Anu the king, entered the exalted dwelling, and
    hid themselves in the summit of heaven.


Column II.


    Those evil spirits, the messengers of Anu their king ...
    They have plotted evil ...
    From mid-heaven like meteors they have rushed upon the earth.
    Bel, who the noble Moon in eclipse
    Saw from heaven,
    Called aloud to Paku his messenger:
    O my messenger Paku, carry my words to the Deep. [55]
    Tell my son that the Moon in heaven is terribly eclipsed!
    To Hea in the Deep repeat this!
    Paku understood the words of his Lord.
    Unto Hea in the Deep swiftly he went.
    To the Lord, the great Inventor, the god Nukimmut,
    Paku repeated the words of his Lord.
    When Hea in the Deep heard these words,
    He bit his lips, and tears bedewed his face.
    Then he sent for his son Marduk to help him.
    Go to my son Marduk,
    Tell my son that the Moon in heaven is terribly eclipsed!
    That eclipse has been seen in heaven!
    They are seven, those evil spirits, and death they fear not!
    They are seven, those evil spirits, who rush like a hurricane,
    And fall like firebrands on the earth!
    In front of the bright Moon with fiery weapons (they draw nigh);
    But the noble Sun and Im the warrior (are withstanding them).


[The rest of the legend is lost.]

Nukimmut is a name of Hea which occurs frequently: he was the good
genius of the earth, and his son Marduk was his incarnation--a Herakles
or Saviour. It will be noted that as yet Ishtar is in heaven. The
next Tablet, which shows the development of the myth, introduces us
to the great female dragon Tiamat herself, and her destroyer Bel.


    ... And with it his right hand he armed.
    His naming sword he raised in his hand.
    He brandished his lightnings before him.
    A curved scymitar he carried on his body.
    And he made a sword to destroy the Dragon,
    Which turned four ways; so that none could avoid its rapid blows.
    It turned to the south, to the north, to the east, and to the west.
    Near to his sabre he placed the bow of his father Anu.
    He made a whirling thunderbolt, and a bolt with double flames,
    impossible to extinguish.
    And a quadruple bolt, and a septuple bolt, and a ... bolt of
    crooked fire.
    He took the thunderbolts which he had made, and there were seven
    of them,
    To be shot at the Dragon, and he put them into his quiver behind
    him.
    Then he raised his great sword, whose name was 'Lord of the Storm.'
    He mounted his chariot, whose name was 'Destroyer of the Impious.'
    He took his place, and lifted the four reins
    In his hand.


[Bel now offers to the Dragon to decide their quarrel by single combat,
which the Dragon accepts. This agrees with the representations of
the combat on Babylonian cylinders in Mr. Smith's 'Chaldean Genesis,'
p. 62, etc.]


    (Why seekest thou thus) to irritate me with blasphemies?
    Let thy army withdraw: let thy chiefs stand aside:
    Then I and thou (alone) we will do battle.
    When the Dragon heard this.
    Stand back! she said, and repeated her command.
    Then the tempter rose watchfully on high.
    Turning and twisting, she shifted her standing point,
    She watched his lightnings, she provided for retreat.
    The warrior angels sheathed their swords.
    Then the Dragon attacked the just Prince of the gods.
    Strongly they joined in the trial of battle,
    The King drew his sword, and dealt rapid blows,
    Then he took his whirling thunderbolt, and looked well behind
    and before him:
    And when the Dragon opened her mouth to swallow him,
    He flung the bolt into her, before she could shut her lips.
    The blazing lightning poured into her inside.
    He pulled out her heart; her mouth he rent open;
    He drew his (falchion), and cut open her belly.
    He cut into her inside and extracted her heart;
    He took vengeance on her, and destroyed her life.
    When he knew she was dead he boasted over her.
    After that the Dragon their leader was slain,
    Her troops took to flight: her army was scattered abroad,
    And the angels her allies, who had come to help her,
    Retreated, grew quiet, and went away.
    They fled from thence, fearing for their own lives,
    And saved themselves, flying to places beyond pursuit.
    He followed them, their weapons he broke up.
    Broken they lay, and in great heaps they were captured.
    A crowd of followers, full of astonishment,
    Its remains lifted up, and on their shoulders hoisted.
    And the eleven tribes pouring in after the battle
    In great multitudes, coming to see,
    Gazed at the monstrous serpent....


In the fragment just quoted we have the 'flaming sword which turned
every way' (Gen. iii. 24). The seven distinct forms of evil are but
faintly remembered in the seven thunderbolts taken by Bel: they are
now all virtually gathered into the one form he combats, and are
thus on their way to form the seven-headed dragon of the Apocalypse,
where Michael replaces Bel. [56] 'The angels, her allies who had come
to help her,' are surely that 'third part of the stars of heaven'
which the apocalyptic dragon's tail drew to the earth in its fall
(Rev. xii. 4). Bel's dragon is also called a 'Tempter.'

At length we reach the brief but clear account of the 'Revolt in
Heaven' found in a cuneiform tablet in the British Museum, and
translated by Mr. Fox Talbot: [57]--


    The Divine Being spoke three times, the commencement of a psalm.
    The god of holy songs, Lord of religion and worship
    seated a thousand singers and musicians: and established a choral
    band who to his hymn were to respond in multitudes....
        With a loud cry of contempt they broke up his holy song
        spoiling, confusing, confounding his hymn of praise.
        The god of the bright crown with a wish to summon his
        adherents sounded a trumpet blast which would wake the dead,
    which to those rebel angels prohibited return
    he stopped their service, and sent them to the gods who were his
    enemies.
        In their room he created mankind.
        The first who received life, dwelt along with him.
        May he give them strength never to neglect his word,
    following the serpent's voice, whom his hands had made.
        And may the god of divine speech expel from his five thousand
        that wicked thousand
    who in the midst of his heavenly song had shouted evil blasphemies!


It will be observed that there were already hostile gods to whom
these riotous angels were sent. It is clear that in both the Egyptian
and Assyrian cosmogonies the upper gods had in their employ many
ferocious monsters. Thus in the Book of Hades, Horus addresses a
terrible serpent: 'My Kheti, great fire, of which this flame in
my eye is the emission, and of which my children guard the folds,
open thy mouth, draw wide thy jaws, launch thy flame against the
enemies of my father, burn their bodies, consume their souls!' [58]
Many such instances could be quoted. In this same book we find a great
serpent, Saa-Set, 'Guardian of the Earth.' Each of the twelve pylons
of Hades is surmounted by its serpent-guards--except one. What has
become of that one? In the last inscription but one, quoted in full,
it will be observed (third line from the last) that eleven ([[angel]])
tribes came in after Bel's battle to inspect the slain dragon. The
twelfth had revolted. These, we may suppose, had listened to 'the
serpent's voice' mentioned in the last fragment quoted.

We have thus distributed through these fragments all the elements
which, from Egyptian and Assyrian sources gathered around the legend
of the Serpent in Eden. The Tree of Knowledge and that of Life are
not included, and I have given elsewhere my reasons for believing
these to be importations from the ancient Aryan legend of the war
between the Devas and Asuras for the immortalising Amrita.

In the last fragment quoted we have also a notable statement, that
mankind were created to fill the places that had been occupied by the
fallen angels. It is probable that this notion supplied the basis
of a class of legends of which Lilith is type. She whose place Eve
was created to fill was a serpent-woman, and the earliest mention
of her is in the exorcism already quoted, found at Nineveh. In all
probability she is but another form of Gula, the fallen Istar and
Queen of Hades; in which case her conspiracy with the serpent Samael
would be the Darkness which was upon the face of Bahu, 'the Deep,'
in the second verse of the Bible.

The Bible opens with the scene of the gods conquering the Dragon of
Darkness with Light. There is a rabbinical legend, that when Light
issued from under the throne of God, the Prince of Darkness asked the
Creator wherefore he had brought Light into existence? God answered
that it was in order that he might be driven back to his abode of
darkness. The evil one asked that he might see that; and entering
the stream of Light, he saw across time and the world, and beheld the
face of the Messiah. Then he fell upon his face and cried, 'This is
he who shall lay low in ruin me and all the inhabitants of hell!'

What the Prince of Darkness saw was the vision of a race: beginning
with the words (Gen. i. 3, 4), 'God said, Let there be Light; and
there was Light; and God saw the Light that it was good; and God
divided between the Light and the Darkness;' ending with Rev. xx. 1,
2, 'And I saw an [[angel]] come down from heaven having the key of the
bottomless pit, and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on
the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil and Satan, and bound
him a thousand years.'







CHAPTER XI.

WAR ON EARTH.

The Abode of Devils--Ketef--Disorder--Talmudic legends--The
restless Spirit--The Fall of Lucifer--Asteria, Hecate, Lilith--The
Dragon's triumph--A Gipsy legend--Caedmon's Poem of the Rebellious
Angels--Milton's version--The Puritans and Prince Rupert--Bel as
ally of the Dragon--A 'Mystery' in Marionettes--European Hells.


'Rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them! Woe to the earth
and the sea! for the devil is come down to you, having great wrath,
because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.' This passage from
the Book of Revelations is the refrain of many and much earlier
scriptures. The Assyrian accounts of the war in heaven, given in
the preceding chapter, by no means generally support the story that
the archdragon was slain by Bel. Even the one that does describe the
chief dragon's death leaves her comrades alive, and the balance of
testimony is largely in favour of the theory which prevailed, that the
rebellious angels were merely cast out of heaven, and went to swell
the ranks of the dark and fearful abode which from the beginning had
been peopled by the enemies of the gods. The nature of this abode is
described in various passages of the Bible, and in many traditions.

'Out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of
the land.' So said Jeremiah (i. 14), in pursuance of nearly universal
traditions as to the region of space in which demons and devils
had their abode. 'Hell is naked before him,' says Job (xxvi. 6),
'and destruction hath no covering. He stretcheth out the north over
the empty place.' According to the Hebrew mythology this habitation
of demons was a realm of perpetual cold and midnight, which Jehovah,
in creating the world, purposely left chaotic; so it was prepared
for the Devil and his angels at the foundation of the world.

Although this northern hell was a region of disorder, so far as the
people of Jehovah and the divine domain were concerned, they had
among themselves a strong military and aristocratic government. It
was disorder perfectly systematised. The anarchical atmosphere of
the region is reflected in the abnormal structures ascribed to the
many devils with whose traits Jewish and Arabic folklore is familiar,
and which are too numerous to be described here. Such a devil, for
instance, is Bedargon, 'hand-high,' with fifty heads and fifty-six
hearts, who cannot strike any one or be struck, instant death ensuing
to either party in such an attack. A more dangerous devil is Ketef,
identified as the 'terror from the chambers' alluded to by Jeremiah
(xxxii. 25), 'Bitter Pestilence.' His name is said to be from kataf,
'cut and split,' because he divides the course of the day; and those
who are interested to compare Hebrew and Hindu myths may find it
interesting to note the coincidences between Ketef and Ketu, the
cut-off tail of Rahu, and source of pestilence. [59] Ketef reigns
neither in the dark or day, but between the two; his power over the
year is limited to the time between June 17 and July 9, during which
it was considered dangerous to flog children or let them go out after
four P.M. Ketef is calf-headed, and consists of hide, hair, and eyes;
he rolls like a cask; he has a terrible horn, but his chief terror
lies in an evil eye fixed in his heart which none can see without
instant death. The arch-fiend who reigns over the infernal host has
many Court Fools--probably meteors and comets--who lead men astray.

All these devils have their regulations in their own domain, but, as
we have said, their laws mean disorder in that part of the universe
which belongs to the family of Jehovah. In flying about the world
they are limited to places which are still chaotic or waste. They
haunt such congenial spots as rocks and ruins, and frequent desert,
wilderness, dark mountains, and the ruins of human habitations. They
can take possession of a wandering star.

There is a pretty Talmudic legend of a devil having once gone to sleep,
when some one, not seeing him of course, set down a cask of wine on
his ears. In leaping up the devil broke the cask, and being tried for
it, was condemned to repay the damage at a certain period. The period
having elapsed before the money was brought, the devil was asked the
cause of the delay. He replied that it was very difficult for devils
to obtain money, because men were careful to keep it locked or tied
up; and 'we have no power,' he said, 'to take from anything bound
or sealed up, nor can we take anything that is measured or counted;
we are permitted to take only what is free or common.'

According to one legend the devils were specially angered, because
Jehovah, when he created man, gave him dominion over things in the
sea (Gen. i. 28), that being a realm of unrest and tempest which they
claimed as belonging to themselves. They were denied control of the
life that is in the sea, though permitted a large degree of power
over its waters. Over the winds their rule was supreme, and it was
only by reducing certain demons to slavery that Solomon was able to
ride in a wind-chariot.

Out of these several realms of order and disorder in nature were
evolved the angels and the devils which were supposed to beset man. The
first man is said to have been like an [[angel]]. From the instant of
his creation there attended him two spirits, whom the rabbins found
shadowed out in the sentence, 'Jehovah-Elohim formed man of the dust
of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life;
and man became a living soul' (Gen. ii. 7). This 'breath of life'
was a holy spirit, and stood on Adam's right; the 'living soul' was a
restless spirit on his left, which continually moved up and down. When
Adam had sinned, this restless spirit became a diabolical spirit,
and it has ever acted as mediator between man and the realm of anarchy.

It has been mentioned that in the Assyrian legends of the Revolt in
Heaven we find no adequate intimation of the motive by which the rebels
were actuated. It is said they interrupted the heavenly song, that they
brought on an eclipse, that they afflicted human beings with disease;
but why they did all this is not stated. The motive of the serpent
in tempting Eve is not stated in Genesis. The theory which Caedmon
and Milton have made so familiar, that the dragons aspired to rival
Jehovah, and usurp the throne of Heaven, must, however, have been
already popular in the time of Isaiah. In his rhapsody concerning
the fall of Babylon, he takes his rhetoric from the story of Bel
and the Dragon, and turns a legend, as familiar to every Babylonian
as that of St. George and the Dragon now is to Englishmen, into an
illustration of their own doom. The invective is directed against
the King of Babylon, consequently the sex of the devil is changed;
but the most remarkable change is in the ascription to Lucifer of a
clear purpose to rival the Most High, and seize the throne of heaven.

'Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming,
it stirreth up the (spirits of) the dead, even all the chief ones
(great goats) of the earth: it hath raised up from their thrones all
the kings of the nations (demon-begotten aliens). All these shall
say unto thee, Art thou also become weak as we? Art thou become like
unto us? Thy splendour is brought down to the underworld, and the
noise of thy viols: the worm is spread under thee, and the worms
cover thee. How art thou fallen, O Lucifer (Daystar), son of the
morning! how art thou cut down to the ground which didst weaken the
nations! For thou hast said in thy heart, I will ascend into (the
upper) heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars (archangels)
of God: I will sit (reign) also upon the mount of the congregation
(the assembly of the enemies of God) in the sides of the north. I will
ascend above the heights of the clouds (the thunder-throne of Jehovah);
I will be like the Most High. Yet shalt thou be brought down to hell,
to the sides of the pit.' [60]

In this passage we mark the arena of the combat shifted from heaven
to earth. It is not the throne of heaven but that of the world at
which the fiends now aim. Nay, there is confession in every line of
the prophecy that the enemy of Jehovah has usurped his throne. Hell
has prevailed, and Lucifer is the Prince of this World. The celestial
success has not been maintained on earth. This would be the obvious
fact to a humiliated, oppressed, heavily-taxed people, who believed
themselves the one family on earth sprung from Jehovah, and their
masters the offspring of demons. This situation gave to the vague
traditions of a single combat between Bel and the Dragon, about an
eclipse or a riot, the significance which it retained ever afterward of
a mighty conflict on earth between the realms of Light and Darkness,
between which the Elohim had set a boundary-line (Gen. i. 4) in
the beginning.

A similar situation returned when the Jews were under the sway of
Rome, and then all that had ever been said of Babylon was repeated
against Rome under the name of Edom. It recurred in the case of those
Jews who acknowledged Jesus as their Messiah: in the pomp and glory
of the Caesars they beheld the triumph of the Powers of Darkness,
and the burthen of Isaiah against Lucifer was raised again in that
of the Apocalypse against the seven-headed Dragon. It is notable how
these writers left out of sight the myth of Eden so far as it did
not belong to their race. Isaiah does not say anything even of the
serpent. The Apocalypse says nothing of the two wonderful trees, and
the serpent appears only as a Dragon from whom the woman is escaping,
by whom she is not at all tempted. The shape of the Devil, and the
Combat with him, have always been determined by dangers and evils
that are actual, not such as are archaeological.

A gipsy near Edinburgh gave me his version of the combat between God
and Satan as follows. 'When God created the universe and all things
in it, Satan tried to create a rival universe. He managed to match
everything pretty well except man. There he failed; and God to punish
his pride cast him down to the earth and bound him with a chain. But
this chain was so long that Satan was able to move over the whole
face of the earth!' There had got into this wanderer's head some bit
of the Babylonian story, and it was mingled with Gnostic traditions
about Ildabaoth; but there was also a quaint suggestion in Satan's
long chain of the migration of this mythical combat not only round
the world, but through the ages.

The early followers of Christ came before the glories of Paganism
with the legend that the lowly should inherit the earth. And though
they speedily surrendered to the rulers of the world in Rome, and made
themselves into a christian aristocracy, when they came into Northern
Europe the christians were again brought to confront with an humble
system the religion of thrones and warriors. St. Gatien celebrating
mass in a cavern beside the Loire, meant as much weakness in presence
of Paganism as the Huguenots felt twelve centuries later hiding in
the like caverns from St. Gatien's priestly successors.

The burthen of Isaiah is heard again, and with realistic intensity,
in the seventh century, and in the north, with our patriarchial
poet Caedmon.


        The All-powerful had
        [[Angel]]-tribes,
        Through might of hand,
        The holy Lord,
        Ten established,
        In whom he trusted well
        That they his service
        Would follow,
        Work his will;
        Therefore gave he them wit,
        And shaped them with his hands,
        The holy Lord.
        He had placed them so happily,
        One he had made so powerful,
        So mighty in his mind's thought,
        He let him sway over so much,
        Highest after himself in heaven's kingdom.
        He had made him so fair,
        So beauteous was his form in heaven,
        That came to him from the Lord of hosts,
        He was like to the light stars.
        It was his to work the praise of the Lord,
        It was his to hold dear his joys in heaven,
        And to thank his Lord
        For the reward that he had bestowed on him in that light;
        Then had he let him long possess it;
        But he turned it for himself to a worse thing,
        Began to raise war upon him,
        Against the highest Ruler of heaven,
        Who sitteth in the holy seat.
        Dear was he to our Lord,
        But it might not be hidden from him
        That his [[angel]] began
        To be presumptuous,
        Raised himself against his Master,
        Sought speech of hate,
        Words of pride towards him,
        Would not serve God,
        Said that his body was
        Light and beauteous,
        Fair and bright of hue:
        He might not find in his mind
        That he would God
        In subjection,
        His Lord, serve:
        Seemed to himself
        That he a power and force
        Had greater
        Than the holy God
        Could have
        Of adherents.
        Many words spake
        The [[angel]] of presumption:
        Thought, through his own power,
        How he for himself a stronger
        Seat might make,
        Higher in heaven:
        Said that him his mind impelled,
        That he west and north
        Would begin to work,
        Would prepare structures:
        Said it to him seemed doubtful
        That he to God would
        Be a vassal.
        'Why shall I toil?' said he;
        'To me it is no whit needful.
        To have a superior;
        I can with my hands as many
        Wonders work;
        I have great power
        To form
        A diviner throne,
        A higher in heaven.
        Why shall I for his favour serve,
        Bend to him in such vassalage?
        I may be a god as he
        Stand by me strong associates,
        Who will not fail me in the strife,
        Heroes stern of mood,
        They have chosen me for chief,
        Renowned warriors!
        With such may one devise counsel,
        With such capture his adherents;
        They are my zealous friends,
        Faithful in their thoughts;
        I may be their chieftain,
        Sway in this realm:
        Thus to me it seemeth not right
        That I in aught
        Need cringe
        To God for any good;
        I will no longer be his vassal.'
        When the All-powerful it
        All had heard,
        That his [[angel]] devised
        Great presumption
        To raise up against his Master,
        And spake proud words
        Foolishly against his Lord,
        Then must he expiate the deed,
        Share the work of war,
        And for his punishment must have
        Of all deadly ills the greatest.
        So doth every man
        Who against his Lord
        Deviseth to war,
        With crime against the great Ruler.
        Then was the Mighty angry;
        The highest Ruler of heaven
        Hurled him from the lofty seat;
        Hate had he gained at his Lord,
        His favour he had lost,
        Incensed with him was the Good in his mind,
        Therefore must he seek the gulf
        Of hard hell-torment,
        For that he had warred with heaven's Ruler,
        He rejected him then from his favour,
        And cast him into hell,
        Into the deep parts,
        Where he became a devil:
        The fiend with all his comrades
        Fell then from heaven above,
        Through as long as three nights and days,
        The angels from heaven into hell;
        And them all the Lord transformed to devils,
        Because they his deed and word
        Would not revere;
        Therefore them in a worse light,
        Under the earth beneath,
        Almighty God
        Had placed triumphless
        In the swart hell;
        There they have at even,
        Immeasurably long,
        Each of all the fiends,
        A renewal of fire;
        Then cometh ere dawn
        The eastern wind,
        Frost bitter-cold,
        Ever fire or dart;
        Some hard torment
        They must have,
        It was wrought for them in punishment,
        Their world was changed:
        For their sinful course
        He filled hell
        With the apostates.


Whether this spirited description was written by Caedmon, and whether
it is of his century, are questions unimportant to the present
inquiry. The poem represents a mediaeval notion which long prevailed,
and which characterised the Mysteries, that Satan and his comrades
were humiliated from the highest angelic rank to a hell already
prepared and peopled with devils, and were there, and by those devils,
severely punished. One of the illuminations of the Caedmon manuscript,
preserved in the Bodleian Library, shows Satan undergoing his torment
(Fig. 3). He is bound over something like a gridiron, and four devils
are torturing him, the largest using a scourge with six prongs. His
face manifests great suffering. His form is mainly human, but his
bushy tail and animal feet indicate that he has been transformed to
a devil similar to those who chastise him.

On Caedmon's foundation Milton built his gorgeous edifice. His
Satan is an ambitious and very English lord, in whom are reflected
the whole aristocracy of England in their hatred and contempt of
the holy Puritan Commonwealth, the Church of Christ as he deemed
it. The ages had brought round a similar situation to that which
confronted the Jews at Babylon, the early Christians of Rome, and
their missionaries among the proud pagan princes of the north. The
Church had long allied itself with the earlier Lucifers of the north,
and now represented the proud empire of a satanic aristocracy, and
the persecuted Nonconformists represented the authority of the King
of kings. In the English palace, and in the throne of Canterbury,
Milton saw his Beelzebub and his Satan.


        Th' infernal serpent; he it was, whose guile,
        Stirred up with envy and revenge, deceived
        The mother of mankind, what time his pride
        Had cast him out from heav'n, with all his host
        Of rebel angels, by whose aid aspiring
        To set himself in glory above his peers
        He trusted to have equall'd the Most High,
        If he opposed; and with ambitious aim
        Against the throne and monarchy of God
        Raised impious war in heav'n, and battle proud,
        With vain attempt. Him the almighty Power
        Hurl'd headlong flaming from th' ethereal sky,
        With hideous ruin and combustion, down
        To bottomless perdition, there to dwell
        In adamantine chains and penal fire,
        Who durst defy th' Omnipotent to arms. [61]


This adaptation of the imagery of Isaiah concerning Lucifer has in
it all the thunder hurled by Cromwell against Charles. Even a Puritan
poet might not altogether repress admiration for the dash and daring
of a Prince Rupert, to which indeed even his prosaic co-religionists
paid the compliment of ascribing to it a diabolical source. [62] Not
amid conflicts that raged in ancient Syria broke forth such lines as--


        Better to reign in hell, than serve in heav'n.

        With rallied arms to try what may be yet
        Regain'd in heav'n, or what more lost in hell.


The Bel whom Milton saw was Cromwell, and the Dragon that serpent
of English oppression which the Dictator is trampling on in a
well-known engraving of his time. In the history of the Reformation
the old legend did manifold duty again, as in the picture (Fig. 13)
by Luther's friend Lucas Cranach.

It would seem that in the course of time Bel and the Dragon became
sufficiently close allies for their worshippers to feed and defend
them both with equal devotion, and for Daniel to explode them both in
carrying on the fight of his deity against the gods of Babylon. This
story of Bel is apocryphal as to the canon, but highly significant as
to the history we are now considering. Although the Jews maintained
their struggle against 'principalities and powers' long after it had
been a forlorn hope, and never surrendered, nor made alliance with the
Dragon, the same cannot be said of those who appropriated their title
of 'the chosen of God,' counterfeited their covenant, and travestied
their traditions. The alliance of Christianity and the Dragon has
not been nominal, but fearfully real. In fulfilling their mission of
'inheriting the earth,' the 'meek' called around them and pressed into
their service agents and weapons more diabolical than any with which
the Oriental imagination had peopled the abode of devils in the north.

At a Fair in Tours (August 1878) I saw two exhibitions which were
impressive enough in the light they cast through history. One was
a shrunken and sufficiently grotesque production by puppets of the
Mediaeval 'Mystery' of Hell. Nearly every old scheme and vision of
the underworld was represented in the scene. The three Judges sat
to hear each case. A devil rang a bell whenever any culprit appeared
at the gate. The accused was ushered in by a winged devil--Satan, the
Accuser--who, by the show-woman's lips, stated the charges against each
with an eager desire to make him or her out as wicked as possible. A
devil with pitchfork received the sentenced, and shoved them down into
a furnace. There was an array of brilliant dragons around, but they
appeared to have nothing to do beyond enjoying the spectacle. But this
exhibition which was styled 'Twenty minutes in Hell,' was poor and
faint beside the neighbouring exhibition of the real Hell, in which
Europe had been tortured for fifteen centuries. Some industrious
Germans had got together in one large room several hundreds of the
instruments of torture by which the nations of the West were persuaded
to embrace Christianity. Every limb, sinew, feature, bone, and nerve of
the human frame had suggested to christian inventiveness some ingenious
device by which it might be tortured. Wheels on which to break bones,
chairs of anguish, thumbscrews, the iron Virgin whose embrace pierced
through every vital part; the hunger-mask which renewed for Christ's
sake the exact torment of Tantalus; even the machine which bore the
very name of the enemy that was cast down--the Dragon's Head! By such
instrumentalities came those quasi-miraculous 'Triumphs of the Cross,'
of which so much has been said and sung! The most salient phenomenon
of christian history is the steady triumph of the Dragon. Misleader
and Deceiver to the last, he is quite willing to sprinkle his fork
and rack with holy water, to cross himself, to label his caldrons
'divine justice,' to write CHRIST upon his forehead; by so doing he
was able to spring his infernal engine on the best nations, and cow
the strongest hearts, till from their pallid lips were wrung the
'confessions of faith,' or the last cry of martyred truth. So was
he able to assault the pure heavens once more, to quench the stars
of human faith and hope, and generate a race of polite, learned,
and civilised hypocrites. But the ancient sunbeams are after him:
the mandate has again gone forth, 'Let there be light,' and the Light
that now breaks forth is not of that kind which respects the limit
of Darkness.







CHAPTER XII.

STRIFE.

Hebrew god of War--Samael--The father's blessing and curse--Esau
--Edom--Jacob and the Phantom--The planet Mars--Tradesman and
Huntsman--'The Devil's Dream.'


        Who is this that cometh from Edom,
        In dyed garments from Bozrah?
        This that is glorious in his apparel,
        Travelling in the greatness of his strength?
        I who promise deliverance, mighty to save.
          Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel,
        And thy garments like him that treadeth the wine-vat?
          I have trodden the wine-press alone;
        And of the peoples there was none with me:
        And I will tread them in mine anger,
        And trample them in my fury;
        And their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments,
        And I will stain all my raiment.
        For the day of vengeance is in my heart,
        And the year of mine avenged is come.
        And I looked, and there was none to help;
        And I wondered that there was none to uphold;
        Therefore mine own arm gained me the victory,
        And mine own fury, it upheld me.
        And I will tread down the peoples in mine anger,
        And make them drunk in my wrath,
        And will bring down their strength to the earth. [63]


This is the picture of the god of War. Upon it the comment in Emek
Hammelech is: 'The colour of the godless Samael and of all his princes
and lords has the aspect of red fire; and all their emanations are
red. Samael is red, also his horse, his sword, his raiment, and the
ground beneath him, are red. In the future the Holy God shall wear
his raiment.' [64] Samael is leader of the Opposition. He is the
Soul of the fiery planet Mars. He is the Creator and inspirer of
all Serpents. Azazel, demon of the Desert, is his First Lord. He was
the terrestrial Chief around whom the fallen angels gathered, and his
great power was acknowledged. All these characters the ancient Rabbins
found blended in his name. Simme (dazzling), Some (blinding), Semol
(the left side), and Samhammaveth (deadly poison), were combined in
the terrible name of Samael. He ruled over the sinister Left. When
Moses, in war with the Amalekites, raised his ten fingers, it was a
special invocation to the Ten Sephiroth, Divine Emanations, because
he knew the power which the Amalekites got from Samael might turn his
own left hand against Israel. [65] The scapegoat was a sacrifice to
him through Azazel.

Samael is the mythologic expression and embodiment of the history of
Esau, afterward Edom. Jacob and Esau represented the sheep and the
goat, divided in the past and to be sundered for ever. As Jacob by
covering his flesh with goat-skins obtained his father's blessing due
to Esau, the Israelites wandering through the wilderness (near Edom's
forbidden domain) seemed to have faith that the offering of a goat
would convince his Viceroy Azazel that they were orthodox Edomites. The
redness of Samael begins with the red pottage from which Esau was
called Edom. The English version does not give the emphasis with which
Esau is said to have called for the pottage--"the red! the red!" The
characteristics ascribed to Esau in the legend are merely a saga built
on the local names with which he was associated. 'Edom' means red,
and 'Seir' means hairy. It probably meant the 'Shaggy Mountains.' [66]

It is interesting to observe the parting of the human and the
theological myths in this story. Jacob is the third person of a
patriarchal trinity,--Abraham the Heavenly Father, Isaac the Laugher
(the Sun), and Jacob the Impostor or Supplanter. As the moon supplants
the sun, takes hold of his heel, shines with his light, so does Jacob
supplant his elder brother; and all the deadliness ascribed to the
Moon, and other Third Persons of Trinities, was inherited by Jacob
until his name was changed by euphemism. As the impartial sun shines
for good and evil, the smile of Isaac, the Laugher, promised great
blessings to both of his sons. The human myth therefore represents
both of them gaining great power and wealth, and after a long feud
they are reconciled. This feature of the legend we shall consider
hereafter. Jehovah has another interest to be secured. He had
declared that one should serve the other; that they should be
cursed who cursed Jacob; and he said, 'Jacob have I loved, Esau
have I hated.' Jahvistic theology had here something more important
than two brothers to harmonise; namely a patriarch's blessing and
a god's curse. It was contrary to all orthodoxy that a man whom
Jehovah hated should possess the blessings of life; it was equally
unorthodox that a father's blessing should not carry with it every
advantage promised. It had to be recorded that Esau became powerful,
lived by his sword, and had great possessions.

It had also to be recorded that 'Edom revolted from under the hand of
Judah and made a king unto themselves,' and that such independence
continued 'unto this day' (2 Kings viii. 20, 22). There was thus no
room for the exhibition of Jacob's superiority,--that is of Israel's
priority over Edom,--in this world; nor yet any room to carry out
Isaac's curse on all who cursed Jacob, and the saying: 'Jacob have
I loved, Esau have I hated, and laid his mountains and his heritage
waste for the dragons of the wilderness' (Mal. i.).

Answers to such problems as these evolve themselves slowly
but inevitably. The agonised cry of the poor girl in Browning's
poem--'There may be heaven, there must be hell'--marks the direction in
which necessity led human speculation many ages before her. A future
had to be invented for the working out of the curse on Esau, who on
earth had to fulfil his father's blessing by enjoying power, wealth,
and independence of his brother. In that future his greatness while
living was repaid by his relegation to the desert and the rock with
the he-goat for his support. Esau was believed to have been changed
into a terrible hairy devil. [67] But still there followed him in his
phantasmal transformation a ghostly environment of his former power
and greatness; the boldest and holiest could not afford to despise
or set aside that 'share' which had been allotted him in the legend,
and could not be wholly set aside in the invisible world.

Jacob's share began with a shrewd bargain with his imprudent
brother. Jacob by his cunning in the breeding of the streaked animals
(Gen. xxx.), by which he outwitted Laban, and other manoeuvres, was
really the cause of bringing on the race called after him that repute
for extortion, affixed to them in such figures as Shylock, which they
have found it so hard to live down. In becoming the great barterers
of the East, their obstacle was the plunderer sallying forth from
the mountain fastnesses or careering over the desert. These were the
traditional descendants of Esau, who gradually included the Ishmaelites
as well as the Edomites, afterwards merged in the Idumeans. But as
the tribal distinctions became lost, the ancient hostility survived
in the abstract form of this satan of Strife--Samael. He came to
mean the spirit that stirs up antagonism between those who should be
brethren. He finally became, and among the more superstitious Jews
still is, instigator of the cruel persecutions which have so long
pursued their race, and the prejudices against them which survive
even in countries to whose wealth, learning, and arts they have
largely contributed. In Jewish countries Edom has long been a name
for the power of Rome and Romanism, somewhat in the same way as the
same are called 'Babylon' by some christians. Jacob, when passing
into the wilderness of Edom, wrestled with the invisible power of
Esau, or Samael, and had not been able to prevail except with a lame
thigh,--a part which, in every animal, Israel thereafter held sacred
to the Opposing Power and abstained from eating. A rabbinical legend
represents Jacob as having been bitten by a serpent while he was
lingering about the boundary of Edom, and before his gift of goats
and other cattle had been offered to his brother. The fiery serpents
which afflicted Israel were universally attributed to Samael, and
the raising of the Brazen Serpent for the homage of the people was an
instance of the uniform deference to Esau's power in his own domain
which was long inculcated.

As I write, fiery Mars, near enough for the astronomer to detect
its moons, is a wondrous phenomenon in the sky. Beneath it fearful
famine is desolating three vast countries, war is raging between
two powerful nations, and civil strife is smiting another ere it has
fairly recovered from the wounds of a foreign struggle. The dismal
conditions seem to have so little root in political necessity that
one might almost be pardoned even now for dreaming that some subtle
influence has come among men from the red planet that has approached
the earth. How easy then must it have been in a similar conjunction of
earthly and celestial phenomena to have imagined Samael, the planetary
Spectre, to be at work with his fatal fires! Whatever may have been
the occasion, the red light of Mars at an early period fixed upon that
planet the odium of all the burning, blighting, desert-producing powers
of which it was thought necessary to relieve the adorable Sun. It
was believed that all 'born under' that planet were quarrelsome. And
it was part of the popular Jewish belief in the ultimate triumph of
good over evil that under Mars the Messias was to be born.

We may regard Esau-Samael then as the Devil of Strife. His traditional
son Cain was like himself a 'murderer from the beginning;' [68] but in
that early period the conflict was between the nomad and the huntsman
on one side, on the other the agriculturist and the cattle-breeder,
who was never regarded as a noble figure among the Semitic tribes. In
the course of time some Semitic tribes became agriculturists, and among
them, in defiance of his archaeological character, Samael was saddled
with the evils that beset them. As an ox he brought rinderpest. But
his visible appearance was still more generally that of the raven,
the wild ass, the hog which brought scurvy; while in shape of a dog
he was so generally believed to bring deadly disease, that it would
seem as if 'hydrophobia' was specially attributed to him.

In process of time benignant Peace dwelt more and more with the
agriculturists, but still among the Israelites the tradesman was
the 'coming man,' and to him peace was essential. The huntsman, of
the Esau clan, figures in many legends, of which the following is
translated from the Arabic by Lane:--There was a huntsman who from a
mountain cave brought some honey in his water-skin, which he offered
to an oilman; when the oilman opened the skin a drop of honey fell
which a bird ate; the oilman's cat sprang on the bird and killed it;
the huntsman's hound killed the cat; the oilman killed the dog; the
huntsman killed the oilman; and as the two men belonged to different
villages, their inhabitants rose against each other in battle,
'and there died of them a great multitude, the number of whom none
knoweth but God, whose name be exalted!' [69]

Esau's character as a wild huntsman is referred to in another
chapter. It is as the genius of strife and nomadic war that he more
directly stands in contrast with his 'supplanter.'

From the wild elemental demons of storm and tempest of the most
primitive age to this Devil of Strife, the human mind has associated
evil with unrest. 'The wicked are like the troubled sea when it cannot
rest.' Such is the burthen of the Japanese Oni throned in the heart
of the hurricane, of the wild huntsman issuing forth at the first
note of war, of Edom hating the victories of peace, living by the
sword. The prophecy that the Prince of Peace should be born under
the planet Mars is a strange and mystical suggestion. In a powerful
poem by Thomas Aird, 'The Devil's Dream,' the last fearful doom of
Satan's vision is imprisonment beneath a lake for ever still,--the
Spirit of Unrest condemned for ever to the realm of absolute stillness!


  There all is solemn idleness: no music here, no jars,
  Where Silence guards the coast, e'er thrill her everlasting bars.
  No sun here shines on wanton isles; but o'er the burning sheet
  A rim of restless halo shakes, which marks the internal heat;
  As, in the days of beauteous earth, we see with dazzled sight
  The red and setting sun o'erflow with rings of welling light.

  Oh! here in dread abeyance lurks of uncreated things
  The last Lake of God's Wrath, where He His first great Enemy brings.
  Deep in the bosom of the gulf the Fiend was made to stay,
  Till, as it seemed, ten thousand years had o'er him rolled away;
  In dreams he had extended life to bear the fiery space;
  But all was passive, dull, and stern within his dwelling-place.

  Oh! for a blast of tenfold ire to rouse the giant surge,
  Him from that flat fixed lethargy impetuously to urge!
  Let him but rise, but ride upon the tempest-crested wave
  Of fire enridged tumultuously, each angry thing he'd brave!
  The strokes of Wrath, thick let them fall! a speed so glorious dread
  Would bear him through, the clinging pains would strip from off
  his head.

  The vision of this Last Stern Lake, oh! how it plagued his soul,
  Type of that dull eternity that on him soon must roll,
  When plans and issues all must cease that earlier care beguiled,
  And never era more shall stand a landmark on the wild:
  Nor failure nor success is there, nor busy hope nor fame,
  But passive fixed endurance, all eternal and the same.







CHAPTER XIII.

BARBARIC ARISTOCRACY.

Jacob, the 'Impostor'--The Barterer--Esau, the 'Warrior'--Barbarian
Dukes--Trade and War--Reconciliation of Jacob and Esau--Their
Ghosts--Legend of Iblis--Pagan Warriors of Europe--Russian
Hierarchy of Hell.


In the preceding chapter it was noted that there were two myths
wrapped up in the story of Jacob and Esau,--the one theological,
the other human. The former was there treated, the latter may be
considered here. Rabbinical theology has made the Jewish race adopt
as their founder that tricky patriarch whom Shylock adopted as his
model; but any censure on them for that comes with little grace
from christians who believe that they are still enjoying a covenant
which Jacob's extortions and treacheries were the divinely-adopted
means of confirming. It is high time that the Jewish people should
repudiate Jacob's proceedings, and if they do not give him his first
name ('Impostor') back again, at least withdraw from him the name
Israel. But it is still more important for mankind to study the phases
of their civilisation, and not attribute to any particular race the
spirit of a legend which represents an epoch of social development
throughout the world.

When Rebekah asked Jehovah why her unborn babes struggled in her
womb, he answered, 'Two nations are in thy womb. One people shall
be stronger than the other people; the elder shall be subject to
the younger.' What peoples these were is described in the blessings
of Jacob on the two representatives when they had grown up to be,
the one red and hairy, a huntsman; the other a quiet man, dwelling
in tents and builder of cattle-booths.

Jacob--cunning, extortionate, fraudulent in spirit even when
technically fair--is not a pleasing figure in the eyes of the
nineteenth century. But he does not belong to the nineteenth
century. His contest was with Esau. The very names of them belong
to mythology; they are not individual men; they are conflicting
tendencies and interests of a primitive period. They must be thought
of as Israel and Edom historically; morally, as the Barter principle
and the Bandit principle.

High things begin low. Astronomy began as Astrology; and when Trade
began there must have been even more trickery about it than there
is now. Conceive of a world made up of nomadic tribes engaged in
perpetual warfare. It is a commerce of killing. If a tribe desires
the richer soil or larger possessions of another, the method is to
exterminate that other. But at last there rises a tribe either too
weak or too peaceful to exterminate, and it proposes to barter. It
challenges its neighbours to a contest of wits. They try to get the
advantage of each other in bargains; they haggle and cheat; and it
is not heroic at all, but it is the beginning of commerce and peace.

But the Dukes of Edom as they are called will not enter into this
compact. They have not been used to it; they are always outwitted
at a bargain; just like those other red men in the West of America,
whose lands are bought with beads, and their territorial birthright
taken for a mess of pottage. They prefer to live by the hunt and by
the sword. Then between these two peoples is an eternal feud, with
an occasional truce, or, in biblical phrase, 'reconciliation.'

Surrounded by a commercial civilisation, with its prosaic virtues and
its petty vices, we cannot help admiring much about the Duke of Edom,
non-producer though he be. Brave, impulsive, quick to forgive as to
resent; generous, as people can afford to be when they may give what
they never earned; his gallant qualities cast a certain meanness
over his grasping brother, the Israelite. It is a healthy sign in
youth to admire such qualities. The boy who delights in Robin Hood;
the youth who feels a stir of enthusiasm when he reads Schiller's
Robbers; the ennuyes of the clubs and the roughs, with unfulfilled
capacities for adventure in them, who admire 'the gallant Turk,' are
all lingering in the nomadic age. They do not think of things but
of persons. They are impressed by the barbaric dash. The splendour
of warriors hides trampled and decimated peasantries; their courage
can gild atrocities. Beside such captivating qualities and thrilling
scenes how poor and commonplace appear thrifty rusticity, and the
cautious, selfish, money-making tradesmen!

But fine and heroic as the Duke of Edom may appear in the distance,
it is best to keep him at a distance. When Robin Hood reappeared on
Blackheath lately, his warmest admirers were satisfied to hear he was
securely lodged in gaol. The Jews had just the same sensations about
the Dukes of Edom. They saw that tribe near to, and lived in daily
dread of them. They were hirsute barbarians, dwelling amid mountain
fastnesses, and lording it over a vast territory. The weak tribe of
the plains had no sooner got together some herds and a little money,
than those dashing Edomites fell upon them and carried away their
savings and substance in a day. This made the bartering tribe all the
more dependent on their cunning. They had to match their wits against,
the world; and they have had to do the same to this day, when it is
a chief element of their survival that their thrift is of importance
to the business and finance of Europe. But in the myth it is shown
that Trade, timorous as it is in presence of the sword, may have a
magnanimity of its own. The Supplanter of Edom is haunted by the wrong
he has done his elder brother, and driven him to greater animosity. He
resolves to seek him, offer him gifts, and crave reconciliation. It is
easy to put an unfavourable construction upon his action, but it is not
necessary. The Supplanter, with droves of cattle, a large portion of
his possessions, passes out towards perilous Edom, unarmed, undefended,
except by his amicable intentions towards the powerful chieftain
he had wronged. At the border of the hostile kingdom he learns that
the chieftain is coming to meet him with four hundred men. He is now
seized, with a mighty spirit of Fear. He sends on the herdsmen with
the herds, and remains alone. During the watches of the night there
closes upon him this phantom of Fear, with its presage of Death. The
tricky tradesman has met his Conscience, and it is girt about with
Terror. But he feels that his nobler self is with it, and that he
will win. Finely has Charles Wesley told the story in his hymn:--


            Come, O thou traveller unknown,
            Whom still I hold but cannot see!
            My company before is gone
            And I am left alone with thee:
            With thee all night I mean to stay
            And wrestle till the break of day.


'Confident in self-despair,' the Supplanter conquers his Fear; with
the dawn he travels onward alone to meet the man he had outraged
and his armed men, and to him says, 'I have appeared before thee as
though I had appeared before God, that thou mightest be favourable
to me.' The proud Duke is disarmed. The brothers embrace and weep
together. The chieftain declines the presents, and is only induced
to accept them as proof of his forgiveness. The Tradesman learns for
all time that his mere cleverness may bring a demon to his side in
the night, and that he never made so good a bargain as when he has
restored ill-gotten gains. The aristocrat and warrior returns to his
mountain, aware now that magnanimity and courage are not impossible
to quiet men living by merchandise. The hunting-ground must make way
now for the cattle-breeder. The sword must yield before the balances.

Whatever may have been the tribes which in primitive times had
these encounters, and taught each other this lesson, they were long
since reconciled. But the ghosts of Israel and Edom, of Barter and
Plunder, fought on through long tribal histories. Israel represented
by the archangel Michael, and Edom by dragon Samael, waged their
war. One characteristic of the opposing power has been already
considered. Samael embodied Edom as the genius of Strife. He was the
especial Accuser of Israel, their Antichrist, so to say, as Michael
was their Advocate. But the name 'Edom' itself was retained as a kind
of personification of the barbaric military and lordly Devil. The
highwayman in epaulettes, the heroic spoiler, with his hairy hand
which Israel itself had imitated many a time in its gloves, were
summed up as 'Edom.'

This personification is the more important since it has characterised
the more serious idea of Satan which prevails in the world. He is
mainly a moral conception, and means the pride and pomp of the world,
its natural wildness and ferocities, and the glory of them. The
Mussulman fable relates that when Allah created man, and placed him
in a garden, he called all the angels to worship this crowning work
of his hands. Iblis alone refused to worship Adam. The very idea of
a garden is hateful to the spirit of Nomadism. [70] Man the gardener
receives no reverence from the proud leader of the Seraphim. God
said unto him (Iblis), What hindered thee from worshipping Adam,
since I commanded thee? He answered, I am more excellent than he:
thou hast created me of (ethereal) fire, and hast created him of clay
(black mud). God said, Get thee down therefore from paradise, for it
is not fit that thou behave thyself proudly therein. [71]

The earnestness and self-devotion of the northern pagans in their
resistance to Christianity impressed the finest minds in the Church
profoundly. Some of the Fathers even quoted the enthusiasm of those
whom they regarded as devotees of the Devil, to shame the apathy of
christians. The Church could show no martyr braver than Rand, down
whose throat St. Olaf made a viper creep, which gnawed through his
side; and Rand was an example of thousands. This gave many of the early
christians of the north a very serious view of the realm of Satan,
and of Satan himself as a great potentate. It was increased by their
discovery that the pagan kings--Satan's subjects--had moral codes and
law-courts, and energetically maintained justice. In this way there
grew up a more dignified idea of Hell. The grotesque imps receded
before the array of majestic devils, like Satan and Beelzebub; and
these were invested with a certain grandeur and barbaric pride. They
were regarded as rival monarchs who had refused to submit themselves to
Jehovah, but they were deemed worthy of heroic treatment. The traces of
this sentiment found in the ancient frescoes of Russia are of especial
importance. Nothing can exceed the grandeur of the Hierarchy of Hell
as they appear in some of these superb pictures. Satan is generally
depicted with similar dignity to the king of heaven, from whom he is
divided by a wall's depth, sometimes even resembling him in all but
complexion and hair (which is fire on Satan). There are frequent
instances, as in the accompanying figure (4), where, in careful
correspondence with the attitude of Christ on the Father's knees,
Satan supports the betrayer of Christ. Beside the king of Hell,
seated in its Mouth, are personages of distinction, some probably
representing those poets and sages of Greece and Rome, the prospect
of whose damnation filled some of the first christian Fathers with
such delight.

In Spain, when a Bishop is about to baptize one of the European
Dukes of the Devil, he asks at the font what has become of his
ancestors, naming them--all heathen. 'They are all in hell!' replies
the Bishop. 'Then there will I follow them,' returns the Chief, and
thereafter by no persuasion can he be induced to fare otherwise than
to Hell. Gradually the Church made up its mind to ally itself with
this obstinate barbaric pride and ambition. It was willing to give
up anything whatever for a kingdom of this world, and to worship any
number of Princes of Darkness, if they would give unto the Bishops
such kingdoms, and the glory of them. They induced Esau to be baptized
by promise of their aid in his oppressions, and free indulgences to
all his passions; and then, by his help, they were able to lay before
weaker Esaus the christian alternatives--Be baptized or burnt!

Not to have known how to conquer in bloodless victories the barbaric
Esaus of the world by a virtue more pure, a heroism more patient,
than theirs, and with that 'sweet reasonableness of Christ,'
which is the latest epitaph on his tomb among the rich; not to have
recognised the true nobility of the Dukes, and purified their pride
to self-reverence, their passion to moral courage, their daring and
freedom to a self-reliance at once gentle and manly; this was no doubt
the necessary failure of a dogmatic and irrational system. But it
is this which has made the christian Israel more of an impostor than
its prototype, in every country to which it came steadily developing
to a hypocritical imitator of the Esau whose birthright it stole
by baptism. It speedily lost his magnanimity, but never his sword,
which however it contrived to make at once meaner and more cruel
by twisting it into thumbscrews and the like. For many centuries
its voice has been, in a thin phonographic way, the voice of Jesus,
but the hands are the hands of Esau with Samael's claw added.







CHAPTER XIV.

JOB AND THE DIVIDER.

Hebrew Polytheism--Problem of Evil--Job's disbelief in a
future life--The Divider's realm--Salted Sacrifices--Theory
of Orthodoxy--Job's reasoning--His humour--Impartiality of
Fortune between the evil and good--Agnosticism of Job--Elihu's
eclecticism--Jehovah of the Whirlwind--Heresies of Job--Rabbinical
legend of Job--Universality of the legend.


        Israel is a flourishing vine,
        Which bringeth forth fruit to itself;
        According to the increase of his fruit
        He hath multiplied his altars;
        According to the goodness of his land
        He hath made goodly images.
        Their heart is divided: now shall they be found guilty;
        He will break down their altars, he will spoil their images.


These words of the prophet Hosea (x. 1, 2) foreshadow the devil which
the devout Jahvist saw growing steadily to enormous strength through
all the history of Israel. The germ of this enemy may be found in our
chapter on Fate; one of its earliest developments is indicated in the
account already given of the partition between Jacob and Esau, and the
superstition to which that led of a ghostly Antagonist, to whom a share
had been irreversibly pledged. From the principle thus adopted, there
grew a host of demons whom it was believed necessary to propitiate by
offering them their share. A divided universe had for its counterpart
a divided loyalty in the heart of the people. The growth of a belief
in the supremacy of one God was far from being a real monotheism; as
a matter of fact no primitive race has been monotheistic. In 2 Kings
xvii. it is stated as a belief of the Jews that some Assyrians who
had been imported into their territory (Samaria) were slain by lions
because they knew not 'the manner of the God of the land.' Spinoza
noticed the indications given in this and other narratives that
the Jews believed that gods whose worship was intolerable within
their own boundaries were yet adapted to other regions (Tractatus,
ii.). With this state of mind it is not wonderful that when the Jews
found themselves in those alien regions they apprehended that the
gods of those countries might also employ lions on such as knew not
their manner, but adhered to the worship of Jehovah too exclusively.

Among the Jews grew up a more spiritual class of minds, whose feeling
towards the mongrel worship around them was that of abhorrence; but
these had a very difficult cause to maintain. The popular superstitions
were firmly rooted in the fact that terrible evils afflicted mankind,
and in the further fact that these did not spare the most pious. Nay,
it had for a long time been a growing belief that the bounties and
afflictions of nature, instead of following the direction promised by
the patriarchs,--rewarding the pious, punishing the wicked,--were
distributed in a reverse way. Dives and Lazarus seemed to have
their respective lots before any future paradise was devised for
their equalisation--as indeed is natural, since Dives attends to
his business, while Lazarus is investing his powers in Abraham's
bosom. Out of this experience there came at last the demand for a
life beyond the grave, without whose redress the pious began to deem
themselves of all men the most miserable. But before this heavenly
future became a matter of common belief, there were theories which
prepared, the way for it. It was held by the devout that the evils
which afflicted the righteous were Jehovah's tests of their loyalty
to him, and that in the end such trials would be repaid. And when
observation, following the theory, showed that they were not so
repaid, it was said the righteousness had been unreal, the devotee
was punished for hidden wickedness. When continued observation had
proved that this theory too was false, and that piety was not paid in
external bounties, either to the good man or his family, the solution
of a future settlement was arrived at.

This simple process may be traced in various races, and in its
several phases.

The most impressive presentation of the experiences under which the
primitive secular theory of rewards and punishments perished, and
that of an adjustment beyond the grave arose, is found in the Book
of Job. The solution here reached--a future reward in this life--is
an impossible one for anything more than an exceptional case. But
the Book of Job displays how beautiful such an instance would be,
showing afflictions to be temporary and destined to be followed by
compensations largely outweighing them. It was a tremendous statement
of the question--If a man die, shall he live again? Jehovah answered,
'Yes' out of the whirlwind, and raised Job out of the dust. But
for the millions who never rose from the dust that voice was heard
announcing their resurrection from a trial that pressed them even
into the grave. It is remarkable that Job's expression of faith that
his Vindicator would appear on earth, should have become the one text
of the Old Testament which has been adapted by christians to express
faith in immortality. Job strongly disowns that faith.


                    There is hope for a tree,
        If it be cut down, that it will sprout again,
        And that its tender branches will not fail;
        Though its root may have grown old in the earth,
        And though its trunk be dead upon the ground,
        At the scent of water it will bud,
        And put forth boughs, like a young plant.
        But man dieth and is gone for ever!

        Yet I know that my Vindicator liveth,
        And will stand up at length on the earth;
        And though with my skin this body be wasted away,
        Yet in my flesh shall I see God.
        Yea, I shall see him my friend;
        My eyes shall behold him no longer an adversary;
        For this my soul panteth within me. [72]


The scenery and details of this drama are such as must have made
an impression upon the mind of the ancient Jews beyond what is now
possible for any existing people. In the first place, the locality
was the land of Uz, which Jeremiah (Lam. iv. 21) points out as part
of Edom, the territory traditionally ruled over by the great invisible
Accuser of Israel, who had succeeded to the portion of Esau, adversary
of their founder, Jacob. Job was within the perilous bounds. And
yet here, where scape-goats were offered to deprecate Samael, and
where in ordinary sacrifices some item entered for the devil's share,
Job refused to pay any honour to the Power of the Place. He offered
burnt-offerings alone for himself and his sons, these being exclusively
given to Jehovah. [73] Even after his children and his possessions were
destroyed by this great adversary, Job offered his sacrifice without
even omitting the salt, which was the Oriental seal of an inviolable
compact between two, and which so especially recalled and consecrated
the covenant with Jehovah. [74] Among his twenty thousand animals,
Azazel's animal, the goat, is not even named. Job's distinction was
an absolute and unprecedented singleness of loyalty to Jehovah.

This loyalty of a disciple even in the enemy's country is
made the subject of a sort of boast by Jehovah when the Accuser
enters. Postponing for the moment consideration of the character and
office of this Satan, we may observe here that the trial which he
challenges is merely a test of the sincerity of Job's allegiance
to Jehovah. The Accuser claims that it is all given for value
received. These possessions are taken away.

This is but the framework around the philosophical poem in which all
theories of the world are personified in grand council.

First of all Job (the Troubled) asks--Why? Orthodoxy answers. (Eliphaz
was the son of Esau (Samael), and his name here means that he was
the Accuser in disguise. He, 'God's strength,' stands for the Law. It
affirms that God's ways are just, and consequently afflictions imply
previous sin.) Eliphaz repeats the question put by the Accuser in
heaven--'Was not thy fear of God thy hope?' And he brings Job to the
test of prayer, in which he has so long trusted. Eliphaz rests on
revelation; he has had a vision; and if his revelation be not true,
he challenges Job to disprove it by calling on God to answer him, or
else securing the advocacy of some one of the heavenly host. Eliphaz
says trouble does not spring out of the dust.

Job's reply is to man and God--Point out the error! Grant my troubles
are divine arrows, what have I done to thee, O watcher of men! Am I
a sea-monster--and we imagine Job looking at his wasted limbs--that
the Almighty must take precautions and send spies against me?

Then follows Bildad the Shuhite,--that is the 'contentious,' one
of the descendants of Keturah (Abraham's concubine), traditionally
supposed to be inimical to the legitimate Abrahamic line, and at a
later period identified as the Turks. Bildad, with invective rather
than argument, charges that Job's children had been slain for their
sins, and otherwise makes a personal application of Eliphaz's theology.

Job declares that since God is so perfect, no man by such standard
could be proved just; that if he could prove himself just, the
argument would be settled by the stronger party in his own favour;
and therefore, liberated from all temptation to justify himself, he
affirms that the innocent and the guilty are dealt with much in the
same way. If it is a trial of strength between God and himself, he
yields. If it is a matter of reasoning, let the terrors be withdrawn,
and he will then be able to answer calmly. For the present, even if
he were righteous, he dare not lift up his head to so assert, while
the rod is upon him.

Zophar 'the impudent' speaks. Here too, probably, is a disguise:
he is (says the LXX.) King of the Minaeans, that is the Nomades, and
his designation 'the Naamathite,' of unknown significance, bears a
suspicious resemblance to Naamah, a mythologic wife of Samael and
mother of several devils. Zophar is cynical. He laughs at Job for
even suggesting the notion of an argument between himself and God,
whose wisdom and ways are unsearchable. He (God) sees man's iniquity
even when it looks as if he did not. He is deeper than hell. What
can a man do but pray and acknowledge his sinfulness?

But Job, even in his extremity, is healthy-hearted enough to laugh
too. He tells his three 'comforters' that no doubt Wisdom will die
with them. Nevertheless, he has heard similar remarks before, and he
is not prepared to renounce his conscience and common-sense on such
grounds. And now, indeed, Job rises to a higher strain. He has made
up his mind that after what has come upon him, he cares not if more
be added, and challenges the universe to name his offence. So long as
his transgression is 'sealed up in a bag,' he has a right to consider
it an invention. [75]

Temanite Orthodoxy is shocked at all this. Eliphaz declares that
Job's assertion that innocent and guilty suffer alike makes the fear
of God a vain thing, and discourages prayer. 'With us are the aged
and hoary-headed.' (Job is a neologist.) Eliphaz paints human nature
in Calvinistic colours.


    Behold, (God) putteth no trust in his ministering spirits,
    And the heavens are not pure in his sight;
    Much less abominable and polluted man,
    Who drinketh iniquity as water!


The wise have related, and they got it from the fathers to whom
the land was given, and among whom no stranger was allowed to bring
his strange doctrines, that affliction is the sign and punishment
of wickedness.

Job merely says he has heard enough of this, and finds no wise man
among them. He acknowledges that such reproaches add to his sorrows. He
would rather contend with God than with them, if he could. But he
sees a slight indication of divine favour in the remarkable unwisdom
of his revilers, and their failure to prove their point.

Bildad draws a picture of what he considers would be the proper
environment of a wicked man, and it closely resembles the situation
of Job.

But Job reminds him that he, Bildad, is not God. It is God that has
brought him so low, but God has been satisfied with his flesh. He
has not yet uttered any complaint as to his conduct; and so he,
Job, believes that his vindicator will yet appear to confront his
accusers--the men who are so glib when his afflictor is silent. [76]

Zophar harps on the old string. Pretty much as some preachers
go on endlessly with their pictures of the terrors which haunted
the deathbeds of Voltaire and Paine, all the more because none are
present to relate the facts. Zophar recounts how men who seemed good,
but were not, were overtaken by asps and vipers and fires from heaven.

But Job, on the other hand, has a curious catalogue of examples in
which the notoriously wicked have lived in wealth and gaiety. And
if it be said God pays such off in their children, Job denies the
justice of that. It is the offender, and not his child, who ought
to feel it. The prosperous and the bitter in soul alike lie down in
the dust at last, the good and the evil; and Job is quite content to
admit that he does not understand it. One thing he does understand:
'Your explanations are false.'

But Eliphaz insists on Job having a dogma. If the orthodox dogma is
not true, put something in its place! Why are you afflicted? What is,
your theory? Is it because God was afraid of your greatness? It must be
as we say, and you have been defrauding and injuring people in secret.

Job, having repeated his ardent desire to meet God face to face as
to his innocence, says he can only conclude that what befalls him and
others is what is 'appointed' for them. His terror indeed arises from
that: the good and the evil seem to be distributed without reference
to human conduct. How darkness conspires with the assassin! If God
were only a man, things might be different; but as it is, 'what he
desireth that he doeth,' and 'who can turn him?'

Bildad falls back on his dogma of depravity. Man is a 'worm,' a
'reptile.' Job finds that for a worm Bildad is very familiar with the
divine secrets. If man is morally so weak he should be lowly in mind
also. God by his spirit hath garnished the heavens; his hand formed
the 'crooked serpent'--


        Lo! these are but the borders of his works;
        How faint the whisper we have heard of him!
        But the thunder of his power who can understand?


Job takes up the position of the agnostic, and the three 'Comforters'
are silenced. The argument has ended where it had to end. Job then
proceeds with sublime eloquence. A man may lose all outward things, but
no man or god can make him utter a lie, or take from him his integrity,
or his consciousness of it. Friends may reproach him, but he can see
that his own heart does not. That one superiority to the wicked he
can preserve. In reviewing his arguments Job is careful to say that
he does not maintain that good and evil men are on an equality. For
one thing, when the wicked man is in trouble he cannot find resource
in his innocence. 'Can he delight himself in the Almighty?' When such
die, their widows do not bewail them. Men do not befriend oppressors
when they come to want. Men hiss them. And with guilt in their heart
they feel their sorrows to be the arrows of God, sent in anger. In
all the realms of nature, therefore, amid its powers, splendours,
and precious things, man cannot find the wisdom which raises him
above misfortune, but only in his inward loyalty to the highest,
and freedom from moral evil.

Then enters a fifth character, Elihu, whose plan is to mediate
between the old dogma and the new agnostic philosophy. He is Orthodoxy
rationalised. Elihu's name is suggestive of his ambiguity; it seems to
mean one whose 'God is He' and he comes from the tribe of Buz, whose
Hebrew meaning might almost be represented in that English word which,
with an added z, would best convey the windiness of his remarks. Buz
was the son of Milkah, the Moon, and his descendant so came fairly
by his theologic 'moonshine' of the kind which Carlyle has so well
described in his account of Coleridgean casuistry. Elihu means to be
fair to both sides! Elihu sees some truth in both sides! Eclectic
Elihu! Job is perfectly right in thinking he had not done anything
to merit his sufferings, but he did not know what snares were
around him, and how he might have done something wicked but for his
affliction. Moreover, God ruins people now and then just to show how
he can lift them up again. Job ought to have taken this for granted,
and then to have expressed it in the old abject phraseology, saying,
'I have received chastisement; I will offend no more! What I see not,
teach thou me!' (A truly Elihuic or 'contemptible' answer to Job's
sensible words, 'Why is light given to a man whose way is hid?' Why
administer the rod which enlightens as to the anger but not its cause,
or as to the way of amend?) In fact the casuistic Elihu casts no light
whatever on the situation. He simply overwhelms him with metaphors and
generalities about the divine justice and mercy, meant to hide this
new and dangerous solution which Job had discovered--namely, that
the old dogmatic theories of evil were proved false by experience,
and that a good man amid sorrow should admit his ignorance, but never
allow terror to wring from him the voice of guilt, nor the attempt
to propitiate divine wrath.

When Jehovah appears on the scene, answering Job out of the whirlwind,
the tone is one of wrath, but the whole utterance is merely an
amplification of what Job had said--what we see and suffer are but
fringes of a Whole we cannot understand. The magnificence and wonder
of the universe celebrated in that voice of the whirlwind had to be
given the lame and impotent conclusion of Job 'abhorring himself,'
and 'repenting in dust and ashes.' The conventional Cerberus must
have his sop. But none the less does the great heart of this poem
reveal the soul that was not shaken or divided in prosperity or
adversity. The burnt-offering of his prosperous days, symbol of a
worship which refused to include the supposed powers of mischief,
was enjoined on Job's Comforters. They must bend to him as nearer God
than they. And in his high philosophy Job found what is symbolised in
the three daughters born to him: Jemima (the Dove, the voice of the
returning Spring); Kezia (Cassia, the sweet incense); Kerenhappuch
(the horn of beautiful colour, or decoration).

From the Jewish point of view this triumph of Job represented a
tremendous heresy. The idea that afflictions could befall a man without
any reference to his conduct, and consequently not to be influenced
by the normal rites and sacrifices, is one fatal to a priesthood. If
evil may be referred in one case to what is going on far away among
gods in obscurities of the universe, and to some purpose beyond the
ken of all sages, it may so be referred in all cases, and though
burnt-offerings may be resorted to formally, they must cease when
their powerlessness is proved. Hence the Rabbins have taken the
side of Job's Comforters. They invented a legend that Job had been
a great magician in Egypt, and was one of those whose sorceries so
long prevented the escape of Israel. He was converted afterwards,
but it is hinted that his early wickedness required the retribution
he suffered. His name was to them the troubler troubled.

Heretical also was the theory that man could get along without any
Angelolatry or Demon-worship. Job in his singleness of service,
fearing God alone, defying the Seraphim and Cherubim from Samael
down to do their worst, was a perilous figure. The priests got no
part of any burnt-offering. The sin-offering was of almost sumptuary
importance. Hence the rabbinical theory, already noticed, that it
was through neglect of these expiations to the God of Sin that the
morally spotless Job came under the power of his plagues.

But for precisely the same reasons the story of Job became
representative to the more spiritual class of minds of a genuine as
contrasted with a nominal monotheism, and the piety of the pure, the
undivided heart. Its meaning is so human that it is not necessary to
discuss the question of its connection with the story of Harischandra,
or whether its accent was caught from or by the legends of Zoroaster
and of Buddha, who passed unscathed through the ordeals of Ahriman
and Mara. It was repeated in the encounters of the infant Christ with
Herod, and of the adult Christ with Satan. It was repeated in the
unswerving loyalty of the patient Griselda to her husband. It is indeed
the heroic theme of many races and ages, and it everywhere points to
a period when the virtues of endurance and patience rose up to match
the agonies which fear and weakness had tried to propitiate,--when
man first learned to suffer and be strong.







CHAPTER XV.

SATAN.

Public Prosecutors--Satan as Accuser--English Devil-worshipper
--Conversion by Terror--Satan in the Old Testament--The trial
of Joshua--Sender of Plagues--Satan and Serpent--Portrait of
Satan--Scapegoat of Christendom--Catholic 'Sight of Hell'--
The ally of Priesthoods.


There is nothing about the Satan of the Book of Job to indicate him
as a diabolical character. He appears as a respectable and powerful
personage among the sons of God who present themselves before Jehovah,
and his office is that of a public prosecutor. He goes to and fro
in the earth attending to his duties. He has received certificates
of character from A. Schultens, Herder, Eichorn, Dathe, Ilgen, who
proposed a new word for Satan in the prologue of Job, which would
make him a faithful but too suspicious servant of God.

Such indeed he was deemed originally; but it is easy to see how the
degradation of such a figure must have begun. There is often a clamour
in England for the creation of Public Prosecutors; yet no doubt there
is good ground for the hesitation which its judicial heads feel in
advising such a step. The experience of countries in which Prosecuting
Attorneys exist is not such as to prove the institution one of unmixed
advantage. It is not in human nature for an official person not to make
the most of the duty intrusted to him, and the tendency is to raise
the interest he specially represents above that of justice itself. A
defeated prosecutor feels a certain stigma upon his reputation as much
as a defeated advocate, and it is doubtful whether it be safe that
the fame of any man should be in the least identified with personal
success where justice is trying to strike a true balance. The recent
performances of certain attorneys in England and America retained by
Societies for the Suppression of Vice strikingly illustrate the dangers
here alluded to. The necessity that such salaried social detectives
should perpetually parade before the community as purifiers of society
induces them to get up unreal cases where real ones cannot be easily
discovered. Thus they become Accusers, and from this it is an easy
step to become Slanderers; nor is it a very difficult one which may
make them instigators of the vices they profess to suppress.

The first representations of Satan show him holding in his hand
the scales; but the latter show him trying slyly with hand or
foot to press down that side of the balance in which the evil
deeds of a soul are being weighed against the good. We need not
try to track archaeologically this declension of a Prosecutor, by
increasing ardour in his office, through the stages of Accuser,
Adversary, Executioner, and at last Rival of the legitimate Rule,
and tempter of its subjects. The process is simple and familiar. I
have before me a little twopenny book, [77] which is said to have
a vast circulation, where one may trace the whole mental evolution
of Satan. The ancient Devil-worshipper who has reappeared with such
power in England tells us that he was the reputed son of a farmer,
who had to support a wife and eleven children on from 7s. to 9s. per
week, and who sent him for a short time to school. 'My schoolmistress
reproved me for something wrong, telling me that God Almighty took
notice of children's sins. This stuck to my conscience a great while;
and who this God Almighty could be I could not conjecture; and how he
could know my sins without asking my mother I could not conceive. At
that time there was a person named Godfrey, an exciseman, in the town,
a man of a stern and hard-favoured countenance, whom I took notice of
for having a stick covered with figures, and an ink-bottle hanging at
the button-hole of his coat. I imagined that man to be employed by
God Almighty to take notice and keep an account of children's sins;
and once I got into the market-house and watched him very narrowly,
and found that he was always in a hurry, by his walking so fast; and I
thought he had need to hurry, as he must have a deal to do to find out
all the sins of children!' This terror caused the little Huntington to
say his prayers. 'Punishment for sin I found was to be inflicted after
death, therefore I hated the churchyard, and would travel any distance
round rather than drag my guilty conscience over that enchanted spot.'

The child is father to the man. When Huntington, S.S., grew up, it
was to record for the thousands who listened to him as a prophet his
many encounters with the devil. The Satan he believes in is an exact
counterpart of the stern, hard-favoured exciseman whom he had regarded
as God's employe. On one occasion he writes, 'Satan began to tempt me
violently that there was no God, but I reasoned against the belief of
that from my own experience of his dreadful wrath, saying, How can I
credit this suggestion, when (God's) wrath is already revealed in my
heart, and every curse in his book levelled at my head.' (That seems
his only evidence of God's existence--his wrath!) 'The Devil answered
that the Bible was false, and only wrote by cunning men to puzzle and
deceive people. 'There is no God,' said the adversary, 'nor is the
Bible true.' ... I asked, 'Who, then, made the world?' He replied,
'I did, and I made men too.' Satan, perceiving my rationality almost
gone, followed me up with another temptation; that as there was no
God I must come back to his work again, else when he had brought me
to hell he would punish me more than all the rest. I cried out, 'Oh,
what will become of me! what will become of me!' He answered that
there was no escape but by praying to him; and that he would show me
some lenity when he took me to hell. I went and sat in my tool-house
halting between two opinions; whether I should petition Satan, or
whether I should keep praying to God, until I could ascertain the
consequences. While I was thinking of bending my knees to such a
cursed being as Satan, an uncommon fear of God sprung up in my heart
to keep me from it.'

In other words, Mr. Huntington wavered between the petitions 'Good
Lord! Good Devil!' The question whether it were more moral, more
holy, to worship the one than the other did not occur to him. He
only considers which is the strongest--which could do him the most
mischief--which, therefore, to fear the most; and when Satan has almost
convinced him in his own favour, he changes round to God. Why? Not
because of any superior goodness on God's part. He says, 'An uncommon
fear of God sprung up in my heart.' The greater terror won the day;
that is to say, of two demons he yielded to the stronger. Such an
experience, though that of one living in our own time, represents a
phase in the development of the relation between God and Satan which
would have appeared primitive to an Assyrian two thousand years
ago. The ethical antagonism of the two was then much more clearly
felt. But this bit of contemporary superstition may bring before us
the period when Satan, from having been a Nemesis or Retributive Agent
of the divine law, had become a mere personal rival of his superior.

Satan, among the Jews, was at first a generic term for an adversary
lying in wait. It is probably the furtive suggestion at the root of
this Hebrew word which aided in its selection as the name for the
invisible adverse powers when they were especially distinguished. But
originally no special personage, much less any antagonist of Jehovah,
was signified by the word. Thus we read: 'And God's anger was kindled
because he (Balaam) went; and the [[angel]] of the Lord stood in the way
for a Satan against him.... And the ass saw the [[angel]] of the Lord
standing in the way and his sword drawn in his hand.' [78] The eyes of
Balaam are presently opened, and the [[angel]] says, 'I went out to be a
Satan to thee because the way is perverse before me.' The Philistines
fear to take David with them to battle lest he should prove a Satan to
them, that is, an underhand enemy or traitor. [79] David called those
who wished to put Shimei to death Satans; [80] but in this case the
epithet would have been more applicable to himself for affecting to
protect the honest man for whose murder he treacherously provided. [81]

That it was popularly used for adversary as distinct from evil appears
in Solomon's words, 'There is neither Satan nor evil occurrent.' [82]
Yet it is in connection with Solomon that we may note the entrance
of some of the materials for the mythology which afterwards invested
the name of Satan. It is said that, in anger at his idolatries,
'the Lord stirred up a Satan unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite:
he was of the king's seed in Edom.' [83] Hadad, 'the Sharp,' bore
a name next to that of Esau himself for the redness of his wrath,
and, as we have seen in a former chapter, Edom was to the Jews the
land of 'bogeys.' 'Another Satan,' whom the Lord 'stirred up,' was
the Devastator, Prince Rezon, founder of the kingdom of Damascus,
of whom it is said, 'he was a Satan to Israel all the days of
Solomon.' [84] The human characteristics of supposed 'Scourges of
God' easily pass away. The name that becomes traditionally associated
with calamities whose agents were 'stirred up' by the Almighty is not
allowed the glory of its desolations. The word 'Satan,' twice used in
this chapter concerning Solomon's fall, probably gained here a long
step towards distinct personification as an eminent national enemy,
though there is no intimation of a power daring to oppose the will of
Jehovah. Nor, indeed, is there any such intimation anywhere in the
'canonical' books of the Old Testament. The writer of Psalm cix.,
imprecating for his adversaries, says: 'Set thou a wicked man over
him; and let Satan stand at his right hand. When he shall be judged,
let him be condemned; and let his prayer become sin.' In this there is
an indication of a special Satan, but he is supposed to be an agent
of Jehovah. In the catalogue of the curses invoked of the Lord,
we find the evils which were afterwards supposed to proceed only
from Satan. The only instance in the Old Testament in which there
is even a faint suggestion of hostility towards Satan on the part of
Jehovah is in Zechariah. Here we find the following remarkable words:
'And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the [[angel]] of
Jehovah, and the Satan standing at his right hand to oppose him. And
Jehovah said unto Satan, Jehovah rebuke thee, O Satan; even Jehovah,
that hath chosen Jerusalem, rebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked
out of the fire? Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and
stood before the [[angel]]. And he answered and spake to those that stood
before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And to
him he said, Lo, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee,
and I will clothe thee with goodly raiment.' [85]

Here we have a very fair study and sketch of that judicial trial of
the soul for which mainly the dogma of a resurrection after death
was invented. The doctrine of future rewards and punishments is not
one which a priesthood would invent or care for, so long as they
possessed unrestricted power to administer such in this life. It is
when an alien power steps in to supersede the priesthood--the Gallio
too indifferent whether ceremonial laws are carried out to permit the
full application of terrestrial cruelties--that the priest requires a
tribunal beyond the grave to execute his sentence. In this picture
of Zechariah we have this invisible Celestial Court. The [[Angel]]
of Judgment is in his seat. The [[Angel]] of Accusation is present to
prosecute. A poor filthy wretch appears for trial. What advocate can
he command? Where is Michael, the special advocate of Israel? He does
not recognise one of his clients in this poor Joshua in his rags. But
lo! suddenly Jehovah himself appears; reproves his own commissioned
Accuser; declares Joshua a brand plucked from the burning (Tophet);
orders a change of raiment, and, condoning his offences, takes him
into his own service. But in all this there is nothing to show general
antagonism between Jehovah and Satan, but the reverse.

When we look into the Book of Job we find a Satan sufficiently
different from any and all of those mentioned under that name in other
parts of the Old Testament to justify the belief that he has been
mainly adapted from the traditions of other regions. The plagues and
afflictions which in Psalm cix. are invoked from Jehovah, even while
Satan is mentioned as near, are in the Book of Job ascribed to Satan
himself. Jehovah only permits Satan to inflict them with a proviso
against total destruction. Satan is here named as a personality in
a way not known elsewhere in the Old Testament, unless it be in 1
Chron. xxi. 1, where Satan (the article being in this single case
absent) is said to have 'stood up against Israel, and provoked David
to number Israel.' But in this case the uniformity of the passage with
the others (excepting those in Job) is preserved by the same incident
being recorded in 2 Sam. xxiv. 1, 'The anger of Jehovah was kindled
against Israel, and he (Jehovah) moved David against them to say,
Go number Israel and Judah.'

It is clear that, in the Old Testament, it is in the Book of Job
alone that we find Satan as the powerful prince of an empire which
is distinct from that of Jehovah,--an empire of tempest, plague, and
fire,--though he presents himself before Jehovah, and awaits permission
to exert his power on a loyal subject of Jehovah. The formality of
a trial, so dear to the Semitic heart, is omitted in this case. And
these circumstances confirm the many other facts which prove this
drama to be largely of non-Semitic origin. It is tolerably clear that
the drama of Harischandra in India and that of Job were both developed
from the Sanskrit legends mentioned in our chapter on Viswamitra; and
it is certain that Aryan and Semitic elements are both represented in
the figure of Satan as he has passed into the theology of Christendom.

Nor indeed has Satan since his importation into Jewish literature
in this new aspect, much as the Rabbins have made of him, ever
been assigned the same character among that people that has been
assigned him in Christendom. He has never replaced Samael as their
Archfiend. Rabbins have, indeed, in later times associated him
with the Serpent which seduced Eve in Eden; but the absence of any
important reference to that story in the New Testament is significant
of the slight place it had in the Jewish mind long after the belief
in Satan had become popular. In fact, that essentially Aryan myth
little accorded with the ideas of strife and immorality which the
Jews had gradually associated with Samael. In the narrative, as
it stands in Genesis, it is by no means the Serpent that makes the
worst appearance. It is Jehovah, whose word--that death shall follow
on the day the apple is eaten--is falsified by the result; and while
the Serpent is seen telling the truth, and guiding man to knowledge,
Jehovah is represented as animated by jealousy or even fear of man's
attainments. All of which is natural enough in an extremely primitive
myth of a combat between rival gods, but by no means possesses the
moral accent of the time and conditions amid which Jahvism certainly
originated. It is in the same unmoral plane as the contest of the
Devas and Asuras for the Amrita, in Hindu mythology, a contest of
physical force and wits.

The real development of Satan among the Jews was from an accusing
to an opposing spirit, then to an agent of punishment--a hated
executioner. The fact that the figure here given (Fig. 5) was
identified by one so familiar with Semitic demonology as Calmet as a
representation of him, is extremely interesting. It was found among
representations of Cherubim, and on the back of one somewhat like
it is a formula of invocation against demons. The countenance is of
that severe beauty which the Greeks ascribed to Nemesis. Nemesis has
at her feet the wheel and rudder, symbols of her power to overtake
the evil-doer by land or sea; the feet of this figure are winged
for pursuit. He has four hands. In one he bears the lamp which, like
Lucifer, brings light on the deed of darkness. As to others, he answers
Baruch's description (Ep. 13, 14) of the Babylonian god, 'He hath a
sceptre in his hand like a man, like a judge of the kingdom--he hath
in his hand a sword and an axe.' He bears nicely-graduated implements
of punishment, from the lash that scourges to the axe that slays; and
his retributive powers are supplemented by the scorpion tail. At his
knees are signets; whomsoever he seals are sealed. He has the terrible
eyes which were believed able to read on every forehead a catalogue
of sins invisible to mortals, a power that made women careful of
their veils, and gave meaning to the formula 'Get thee behind me!' [86]

Now this figure, which Calmet believed to be Satan, bears on its
reverse, 'The Everlasting Sun.' He is a god made up of Egyptian and
Magian forms, the head-plumes belonging to the one, the multiplied
wings to the other. Matter (Hist. Crit. de Gnost.) reproduces it,
and says that 'it differs so much from all else of the kind as to
prove it the work of an impostor.' But Professor C. W. King has a
(probably fifth century) gem in his collection evidently a rude copy
of this (reproduced in his 'Gnostics,' Pl. xi. 3), on the back of
which is 'Light of Lights;' and, in a note which I have from him,
he says that it sufficiently proves Matter wrong, and that this form
was primitive. In one gem of Professor King's (Pl. v. 1) the lamp
is also carried, and means the 'Light of Lights.' The inscription
beneath, within a coiled serpent, is in corrupt cuneiform characters,
long preserved by the Magi, though without understanding them. There
is little doubt, therefore, that the instinct of Calmet was right,
and that we have here an early form of the detective and retributive
Magian deity ultimately degraded to an accusing spirit, or Satan.

Although the Jews did not identify Satan with their Scapegoat, yet
he has been veritably the Scapegoat among devils for two thousand
years. All the nightmares and phantasms that ever haunted the human
imagination have been packed upon him unto this day, when it is
almost as common to hear his name in India and China as in Europe and
America. In thus passing round the world, he has caught the varying
features of many fossilised demons: he has been horned, hoofed,
reptilian, quadrupedal, anthropoid, anthropomorphic, beautiful, ugly,
male, female; the whites painted him black, and the blacks, with
more reason, painted him white. Thus has Satan been made a miracle
of incongruities. Yet through all these protean shapes there has
persisted the original characteristic mentioned. He is prosecutor
and executioner under the divine government, though his office has
been debased by that mental confusion which, in the East, abhors the
burner of corpses, and, in the West, regards the public hangman with
contempt; the abhorrence, in the case of Satan, being intensified
by the supposition of an overfondness for his work, carried to the
extent of instigating the offences which will bring him victims.

In a well-known English Roman Catholic book [87] of recent times, there
is this account of St. Francis' visit to hell in company with the [[Angel]]
Gabriel:--'St. Francis saw that, on the other side of (a certain) soul,
there was another devil to mock at and reproach it. He said, Remember
where you are, and where you will be for ever; how short the sin was,
how long the punishment. It is your own fault; when you committed that
mortal sin you knew how you would be punished. What a good bargain you
made to take the pains of eternity in exchange for the sin of a day,
an hour, a moment. You cry now for your sin, but your crying comes
too late. You liked bad company; you will find bad company enough
here. Your father was a drunkard, look at him there drinking red-hot
fire. You were too idle to go to mass on Sundays; be as idle as you
like now, for there is no mass to go to. You disobeyed your father,
but you dare not disobey him who is your father in hell.'

This devil speaks as one carrying out the divine decrees. He
preaches. He utters from his chasuble of flame the sermons of Father
Furniss. And, no doubt, wherever belief in Satan is theological, this
is pretty much the form which he assumes before the mind (or what such
believers would call their mind, albeit really the mind of some Syrian
dead these two thousand years). But the Satan popularly personalised
was man's effort to imagine an enthusiasm of inhumanity. He is the
necessary appendage to a personalised Omnipotence, whose thoughts are
not as man's thoughts, but claim to coerce these. His degradation
reflects the heartlessness and the ingenuity of torture which must
always represent personal government with its catalogue of fictitious
crimes. Offences against mere Majesty, against iniquities framed in
law, must be doubly punished, the thing to be secured being doubly
weak. Under any theocratic government law and punishment would become
the types of diabolism. Satan thus has a twofold significance. He
reports what powerful priesthoods found to be the obstacles to their
authority; and he reports the character of the priestly despotisms
which aimed to obstruct human development.







CHAPTER XVI.

RELIGIOUS DESPOTISM.

Pharaoh and Herod--Zoroaster's mother--Ahriman's emissaries--Kansa
and Krishna--Emissaries of Kansa--Astyages and Cyrus--Zohak--Bel
and the Christian.


The Jews had already, when Christ appeared, formed the theory that
the hardening of Pharaoh's heart, and his resistance to the departure
of Israel from Egypt, were due to diabolical sorcery. The belief
afterwards matured; that Edom (Esau or Samael) was the instigator
of Roman aggression was steadily forming. The mental conditions
were therefore favourable to the growth of a belief in the Jewish
followers of Christ that the hostility to the religious movement
of their time was another effort on the part of Samael to crush
the kingdom of God. Herod was not, indeed, called Satan or Samael,
nor was Pharaoh; but the splendour and grandeur of this Idumean
(the realm of Esau), notwithstanding his oppressions and crimes,
had made him a fair representative to the people of the supernatural
power they dreaded. Under these circumstances it was a powerful appeal
to the sympathies of the Jewish people to invent in connection with
Herod a myth exactly similar to that associated with Pharaoh,--namely,
a conspiracy with sorcerers, and consequent massacre of all new-born
children.

The myths which tell of divine babes supernaturally saved from royal
hostility are veritable myths, even where they occur so late in
time that historic names and places are given; for, of course, it is
impossible that by any natural means either Pharaoh or Herod should be
aware of the peculiar nature of any particular infant born in their
dominions. Such traditions, when thus presented in historical guise,
can only be explained by reference to corresponding fables written out
in simpler mythic form; while it is especially necessary to remember
that such corresponding narratives may be of independent ethnical
origin, and that the later in time may be more primitive spiritually.

In the Legend of Zoroaster [88] his mother Dogdo, previous to his
birth, has a dream in which she sees a black cloud, which, like
the wing of some vast bird, hides the sun, and brings on frightful
darkness. This cloud rains down on her house terrible beasts with
sharp teeth,--tigers, lions, wolves, rhinoceroses, serpents. One
monster especially attacks her with great fury, and her unborn babe
speaks in reassuring terms. A great light rises and the beasts fall. A
beautiful youth appears, hurls a book at the Devas (Devils), and they
fly, with exception of three,--a wolf, a lion, and a tiger. These,
however, the youth drives away with a luminous horn. He then replaces
the holy infant in the womb, and says to the mother: 'Fear nothing! The
King of Heaven protects this infant. The earth waits for him. He is
the prophet whom Ormuzd sends to his people: his law will fill the
world with joy: he will make the lion and the lamb drink in the same
place. Fear not these ferocious beasts; why should he whom Ormuzd
preserves fear the enmity of the whole world?' With these words
the youth vanished, and Dogdo awoke. Repairing to an interpreter,
she was told that the Horn meant the grandeur of Ormuzd; the Book
was the Avesta; the three Beasts betokened three powerful enemies.

Zoroaster was born laughing. This prodigy being noised abroad, the
Magicians became alarmed, and sought to slay the child. One of them
raised a sword to strike him, but his arm fell to the ground. The
Magicians bore the child to the desert, kindled a fire and threw him
into it, but his mother afterwards found him sleeping tranquilly and
unharmed in the flames. Next he was thrown in front of a drove of
cows and bulls, but the fiercest of the bulls stood carefully over
the child and protected him. The Magicians killed all the young of
a pack of wolves, and then cast the infant Zoroaster to them that
they might vent their rage upon him, but the mouths of the wolves
were shut. They abandoned the child on a lonely mountain, but two
ewes came and suckled him.

Zoroaster's father respected the ministers of the Devas (Magi),
but his child rebuked him. Zoroaster walked on the water (crossing
a great river where was no bridge) on his way to Mount Iran where he
was to receive the Law. It was then he had the vision of the battle
between the two serpent armies,--the white and black adders, the
former, from the South, conquering the latter, which had come from
the North to destroy him.

The Legend of the Infant Krishna is as follows:--The tyrant Kansa,
having given his sister Devaki in marriage to Vasudeva, as he was
returning from the wedding heard a voice declare, 'The eighth son of
Devaki is destined to be thy destroyer.' Alarmed at this, Kansa cast
his sister and her husband into a prison with seven iron doors, and
whenever a son was born he caused it to be instantly destroyed. When
Devaki became pregnant the eighth time, Brahma and Siva, with attending
Devas, appeared and sang: 'O favoured among women! in thy delivery all
nature shall have cause to exult! How ardently we long to behold that
face for the sake of which we have coursed round three worlds!' When
Krishna was born a chorus of celestial spirits saluted him; the room
was illumined with supernatural light. While Devaki was weeping at the
fatal decree of Kansa that her son should be destroyed, a voice was
heard by Vasudeva saying: 'Son of Yadu, carry this child to Gokul,
on the other side of the river Jumna, to Nauda, whose wife has just
given birth to a daughter. Leave him and bring the girl hither.' At
this the seven doors swung open, deep sleep fell on the guards,
and Vasudeva went forth with the holy infant in his arms. The river
Jumna was swollen, but the waters, having kissed the feet of Krishna,
retired on either side, opening a pathway. The great serpent of
Vishnu held its hood over this new incarnation of its Lord. Beside
sleeping Nauda and his wife the daughter was replaced by the son,
who was named Krishna, the Dark.

When all this had happened a voice came to Kansa saying: 'The boy
destined to destroy thee is born, and is now living.' Whereupon Kansa
ordered all the male children in his kingdom to be destroyed. This
being ineffectual, the whereabouts of Krishna were discovered; but the
messenger who was sent to destroy the child beheld its image in the
water and adored it. The Rakshasas worked in the interest of Kansa. One
approached the divine child in shape of a monstrous bull whose head
he wrung off; and he so burned in the stomach of a crocodile which
had swallowed him that the monster cast him from his mouth unharmed.

Finally, as a youth, Krishna, after living some time as a herdsman,
attacked the tyrant Kansa, tore the crown from his head, and dragged
him by his hair a long way; with the curious result that Kansa became
liberated from the three worlds, such virtue had long thinking about
the incarnate one, even in enmity!

The divine beings represented in these legends find their complement
in the fabulous history of Cyrus; and the hostile powers which
sought their destruction are represented in demonology by the Persian
tyrant-devil Zohak. The name of Astyages, the grandfather of Cyrus,
has been satisfactorily traced to Ashdahak, and Ajis Dahaka, the
'biting snake.' The word thus connects him with Vedic Ahi and with
Iranian Zohak, the tyrant out of whose shoulders a magician evoked
two serpents which adhered to him and became at once his familiars and
the arms of his cruelty. As Astyages, the last king of Media, he had
a dream that the offspring of his daughter Mandane would reign over
Asia. He gave her in marriage to Cambyses, and when she bore a child
(Cyrus), committed it to his minister Harpagus to be slain. Harpagus,
however, moved with pity, gave it to a herdsman of Astyages, who
substituted for it a still-born child, and having so satisfied the
tyrant of its death, reared Cyrus as his own son.

The luminous Horn of the Zoroastrian legend and the diabolism
of Zohak are both recalled in the Book of Daniel (viii.) in the
terrific struggle of the ram and the he-goat. The he-goat, ancient
symbol of hairy Esau, long idealised into the Invisible Foe of
Israel, had become associated also with Babylon and with Nimrod
its founder, the Semitic Zohak. But Bel, conqueror of the Dragon,
was the founder of Babylon, and to Jewish eyes the Dragon was his
familiar; to the Jews he represented the tyranny and idolatry of
Nimrod, the two serpents of Zohak. When Cyrus supplanted Astyages,
this was the idol he found the Babylonians worshipping until Daniel
destroyed it. And so, it would appear, came about the fact that to
the Jews the power of Christendom came to be represented as the Reign
of Bel. One can hardly wonder at that. If ever there were cruelty
and oppression passing beyond the limit of mere human capacities, it
has been recorded in the tragical history of Jewish sufferings. The
disbeliever in praeternatural powers of evil can no less than others
recognise in this 'Bel and the Christian,' which the Jews substituted
for 'Bel and the Dragon,' the real archfiend--Superstition, turning
human hearts to stone when to stony gods they sacrifice their own
humanity and the welfare of mankind.







CHAPTER XVII.

THE PRINCE OF THIS WORLD.

Temptations--Birth of Buddha--Mara--Temptation of power--Asceticism
and Luxury--Mara's menaces--Appearance of the Buddha's
Vindicator--Ahriman tempts Zoroaster--Satan and Christ--Criticism
of Strauss--Jewish traditions--Hunger--Variants.


The Devil, having shown Jesus all the kingdoms of this world, said,
'All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is
delivered unto me, and to whomsoever I will I give it,' The theory
thus announced is as a vast formation underlying many religions. As
every religion begins as an ideal, it must find itself in antagonism
to the world at large; and since the social and political world
are themselves, so long as they last, the outcome of nature, it is
inevitable that in primitive times the earth should be regarded as a
Satanic realm, and the divine world pictured elsewhere. A legitimate
result of this conclusion is asceticism, and belief in the wickedness
of earthly enjoyments. To men of great intellectual powers, generally
accompanied as they are with keen susceptibilities of enjoyment and
strong sympathies, the renunciation of this world must be as a living
burial. To men who, amid the corruptions of the world, feel within them
the power to strike in with effect, or who, seeing 'with how little
wisdom the world is governed,' are stirred by the sense of power, the
struggle against the temptation to lead in the kingdoms of this world
is necessarily severe. Thus simple is the sense of those temptations
which make the almost invariable ordeal of the traditional founders
of religions. As in earlier times the god won his spurs, so to say,
by conquering some monstrous beast, the saint or saviour must have
overcome some potent many-headed world, with gems for scales and
double-tongue, coiling round the earth, and thence, like Lilith's
golden hair, round the heart of all surrendered to its seductions.

It is remarkable to note the contrast between the visible and
invisible worlds which surrounded the spiritual pilgrimage of Sakya
Muni to Buddhahood or enlightenment. At his birth there is no trace
of political hostility: the cruel Kansa, Herod, Magicians seeking to
destroy, are replaced by the affectionate force of a king trying to
retain his son. The universal traditions reach their happy height in
the ecstatic gospels of the Siamese. [89] The universe was illumined;
all jewels shown with unwonted lustre; the air was full of music;
all pain ceased; the blind saw, the deaf heard; the birds paused
in their flight; all trees and plants burst into bloom, and lotus
flowers appeared in every place. Not under the dominion of Mara [90]
was this beautiful world. But by turning from all its youth, health,
and life, to think only of its decrepitude, illness, and death, the
Prince Sakya Muni surrounded himself with another world in which Mara
had his share of power. I condense here the accounts of his encounters
with the Prince, who was on his way to be a hermit.

When the Prince passed out at the palace gates, the king Mara,
knowing that the youth was passing beyond his evil power, determined
to prevent him. Descending from his abode and floating in the air,
Mara cried, 'Lord, thou art capable of such vast endurance, go not
forth to adopt a religious life, but return to thy kingdom, and in
seven days thou shalt become an emperor of the world, ruling over
the four great continents.' 'Take heed, O Mara!' replied the Prince;
'I also know that in seven days I might gain universal empire, but
I have no desire for such possessions. I know that the pursuit of
religion is better than the empire of the world. See how the world
is moved, and quakes with praise of this my entry on a religious
life! I shall attain the glorious omniscience, and shall teach the
wheel of the law, that all teachable beings may free themselves from
transmigratory existence. You, thinking only of the lusts of the flesh,
would force me to leave all beings to wander without guide into your
power. Avaunt! get thee away far from me!'

Mara withdrew, but only to watch for another opportunity. It came when
the Prince had reduced himself to emaciation and agony by the severest
austerities. Then Mara presented himself, and pretending compassion,
said, 'Beware, O grand Being! Your state is pitiable to look on; you
are attenuated beyond measure, and your skin, that was of the colour of
gold, is dark and discoloured. You are practising this mortification
in vain. I can see that you will not live through it. You, who are a
Grand Being, had better give up this course, for be assured you will
derive much more advantage from sacrifices of fire and flowers.' Him
the Grand Being indignantly answered, 'Hearken, thou vile and wicked
Mara! Thy words suit not the time. Think not to deceive me, for I
heed thee not. Thou mayest mislead those who have no understanding,
but I, who have virtue, endurance, and intelligence, who know what
is good and what is evil, cannot be so misled. Thou, O Mara! hast
eight generals. Thy first is delight in the five lusts of the flesh,
which are the pleasures of appearance, sound, scent, flavour, and
touch. Thy second general is wrath, who takes the form of vexation,
indignation, and desire to injure. Thy third is concupiscence. Thy
fourth is desire. Thy fifth is impudence. Thy sixth is arrogance. Thy
seventh is doubt. And thine eighth is ingratitude. These are thy
generals, who cannot be escaped by those whose hearts are set on
honour and wealth. But I know that he who can contend with these thy
generals shall escape beyond all sorrow, and enjoy the most glorious
happiness. Therefore I have not ceased to practise mortification,
knowing that even were I to die whilst thus engaged, it would be a
most excellent thing.'

It is added that Mara 'fled in confusion,' but the next incident
seems to show that his suggestion was not unheeded; for 'after he
had departed,' the Grand Being had his vision of the three-stringed
guitar--one string drawn too tightly, the second too loosely, the third
moderately--which last, somewhat in defiance of orchestral ideas,
alone gave sweet music, and taught him that moderation was better
than excess or laxity. By eating enough he gained that pristine
strength and beauty which offended the five Brahmans so that they
left him. The third and final effort of Mara immediately preceded
the Prince's attainment of the order of Buddha under the Bo-tree. He
now sent his three daughters, Raka (Love), Aradi (Anger), Tanha
(Desire). Beautifully bedecked they approached him, and Raka said,
'Lord, fearest thou not death?' But he drove her away. The two others
also he drove away as they had no charm of sufficient power to entice
him. Then Mara assembled his generals, and said, 'Listen, ye Maras,
that know not sorrow! Now shall I make war on the Prince, that man
without equal. I dare not attack him in face, but I will circumvent
him by approaching on the north side. Assume then all manner of shapes,
and use your mightiest powers, that he may flee in terror.'

Having taken on fearful shapes, raising awful sounds, headed by
Mara himself, who had assumed immense size, and mounted his elephant
Girimaga, a thousand miles in height, they advanced; but they dare not
enter beneath the shade of the holy Bo-tree. They frightened away,
however, the Lord's guardian angels, and he was left alone. Then
seeing the army approaching from the north, he reflected, 'Long have I
devoted myself to a life of mortification, and now I am alone, without
a friend to aid me in this contest. Yet may I escape the Maras,
for the virtue of my transcendent merits will be my army.' 'Help
me,' he cried, 'ye thirty Barami! ye powers of accumulated merit,
ye powers of Almsgiving, Morality, Relinquishment, Wisdom, Fortitude,
Patience, Truth, Determination, Charity, and Equanimity, help me in
my fight with Mara!' The Lord was seated on his jewelled throne (the
same that had been formed of the grass on which he sat), and Mara
with his army exhausted every resource of terror--monstrous beasts,
rain of missiles and burning ashes, gales that blew down mountain
peaks--to inspire him with fear; but all in vain! Nay, the burning
ashes were changed to flowers as they fell.

'Come down from thy throne,' shouted the evil-formed one; 'come down,
or I will cut thine heart into atoms!' The Lord replied, 'This jewelled
throne was created by the power of my merits, for I am he who will
teach all men the remedy for death, who will redeem all beings,
and set them free from the sorrows of circling existence.'

Mara then claimed that the throne belonged to himself, and had been
created by his own merits; and on this armed himself with the Chakkra,
the irresistible weapon of Indra, and Wheel of the Law. Yet Buddha
answered, 'By the thirty virtues of transcendent merits, and the five
alms, I have obtained the throne. Thou, in saying that this throne
was created by thy merits, tellest an untruth, for indeed there is
no throne for a sinful, horrible being such as thou art.'

Then furious Mara hurled the Chakkra, which clove mountains in its
course, but could not pass a canopy of flowers which rose over the
Lord's head.

And now the great Being asked Mara for the witnesses of his acts of
merit by virtue of which he claimed the throne. In response, Mara's
generals all bore him witness. Then Mara challenged him, 'Tell me now,
where is the man that can bear witness for thee?' The Lord reflected,
'Truly here is no man to bear me witness, but I will call on the earth
itself, though it has neither spirit nor understanding, and it shall
be my witness.' Stretching forth his hand, he thus invoked the earth:
'O holy Earth! I who have attained the thirty powers of virtue,
and performed the five great alms, each time that I have performed a
great act have not failed to pour water on thee. Now that I have no
other witness, I call upon thee to give thy testimony!'

The [[angel]] of the earth appeared in shape of a lovely woman, and
answered, 'O Being more excellent than angels or men! it is true
that, when you performed your great works, you ever poured water on
my hair.' And with these words she wrung her long hair, and from it
issued a stream, a torrent, a flood, in which Mara and his hosts were
overturned, their insignia destroyed, and King Mara put to flight,
amid the loud rejoicings of angels.

Then the evil one and his generals were conquered not only in power but
in heart; and Mara, raising his thousand arms, paid reverence, saying,
'Homage to the Lord, who has subdued his body even as a charioteer
breaks his horses to his use! The Lord will become the omniscient
Buddha, the Teacher of angels, and Brahmas, and Yakkhas (demons),
and men. He will confound all Maras, and rescue men from the whirl
of transmigration!'

The menacing powers depicted as assailing Sakya Muni appear only
around the infancy of Zoroaster. The interview of the latter with
Ahriman hardly amounts to a severe trial, but still the accent of
the chief temptation both of Buddha and Christ is in it, namely,
the promise of worldly empire. It was on one of those midnight
journeys through Heaven and Hell that Zoroaster saw Ahriman, and
delivered from his power 'one who had done both good and evil.' [91]
When Ahriman met Zoroaster's gaze, he cried, 'Quit thou the pure law;
cast it to the ground; thou wilt then be in the world all that thou
canst desire. Be not anxious about thy end. At least, do not destroy
my subjects, O pure Zoroaster, son of Poroscharp, who art born of
her thou hast borne!' Zoroaster answered, 'Wicked Majesty! it is for
thee and thy worshippers that Hell is prepared, but by the mercy of
God I shall bury your work with shame and ignominy.'

In the account of Matthew, Satan begins his temptation of Jesus in
the same way and amid similar circumstances to those we find in the
Siamese legends of Buddha. It occurs in a wilderness, and the appeal
is to hunger. The temptation of Buddha, in which Mara promises the
empire of the world, is also repeated in the case of Satan and Jesus
(Fig. 6). The menaces, however, in this case, are relegated to the
infancy, and the lustful temptation is absent altogether. Mark has an
allusion to his being in the wilderness forty days 'with the beasts,'
which may mean that Satan 'drove' him into a region of danger to
inspire fear. In Luke we have the remarkable claim of Satan that
the authority over the world has been delivered to himself, and he
gives it to whom he will; which Jesus does not deny, as Buddha did
the similar claim of Mara. As in the case of Buddha, the temptation
of Jesus ends his fasting; angels bring him food (diekonoun ayto
probably means that), and thenceforth he eats and drinks, to the
scandal of the ascetics.

The essential addition in the case of Jesus is the notable temptation
to try and perform a crucial act. Satan quotes an accredited messianic
prophecy, and invites Jesus to test his claim to be the predicted
deliverer by casting himself from the pinnacle of the Temple,
and testing the promise that angels should protect the true Son
of God. Strauss, [92] as it appears to me, has not considered the
importance of this in connection with the general situation. 'Assent,'
he says, 'cannot be withheld from the canon that, to be credible,
the narrative must ascribe nothing to the devil inconsistent with his
established cunning. Now, the first temptation, appealing to hunger,
we grant, is not ill-conceived; if this were ineffectual, the devil,
as an artful tactician, should have had a yet more alluring temptation
at hand; but instead of this, we find him, in Matthew, proposing to
Jesus the neck-breaking feat of casting himself down from the pinnacle
of the Temple--a far less inviting miracle than the metamorphosis of
the stones. This proposition finding no acceptance, there follows,
as a crowning effort, a suggestion which, whatever might be the bribe,
every true Israelite would instantly reject with abhorrence--to fall
down and worship the devil.'

Not so! The scapegoat was a perpetual act of worship to the Devil. In
this story of the temptation of Christ there enter some characteristic
elements of the temptation of Job. [93] Uz in the one case and the
wilderness in the other mean morally the same, the region ruled over
by Azazel. In both cases the trial is under divine direction. And
the trial is in both cases to secure a division of worship between
the good and evil powers, which was so universal in the East that
it was the test of exceptional piety if one did not swerve from
an unmixed sacrifice. Jesus is apparently abandoned by the God in
whom he trusted; he is 'driven' into a wilderness, and there kept
with the beasts and without food. The Devil alone comes to him;
exhibits his own miraculous power by bearing him through the air to
his own Mount Seir, and showing him the whole world in a moment of
time; and now says to him, as it were, 'Try your God! See if he will
even turn stones into bread to save his own son, to whom I offer the
kingdoms of the world!' Then bearing him into the 'holy hill' of his
own God--the pinnacle of the Temple--says, 'Try now a leap, and see
if he saves from being dashed to pieces, even in his own precincts,
his so trustful devotee, whom I have borne aloft so safely! Which,
then, has the greater power to protect, enrich, advance you,--he who
has left you out here to starve, so that you dare not trust yourself to
him, or I? Fall down then and worship me as your God, and all the world
is yours! It is the world you are to reign over: rule it in my name!

When St. Anthony is tempted by the Devil in the form of a lean monk,
it was easy to see that the hermit was troubled with a vision of his
own emaciation. When the Devil appears to Luther under guise of a holy
monk, it is an obvious explanation that he was impressed by a memory
of the holy brothers who still remained in the Church, and who, while
they implored his return, pointed out the strength and influence he had
lost by secession. Equally simple are the moral elements in the story
of Christ's temptation. While a member of John's ascetic community,
for which 'though he was rich he became poor,' hunger, and such
anxiety about a living as victimises many a young thinker now, must
have assailed him. Later on his Devil meets him on the Temple, quotes
scripture, and warns him that his visionary God will not raise him so
high in the Church as the Prince of this World can. [94] And finally,
when dreams of a larger union, including Jews and Gentiles, visited
him, the power that might be gained by connivance with universal
idolatry would be reflected in the offer of the kingdoms of the world
in payment for the purity of his aims and singleness of his worship.

That these trials of self-truthfulness and fidelity, occurring
at various phases of life, would be recognised, is certain. A
youth of high position, as Christ probably was, [95] or even one
with that great power over the people which all concede, was, in a
worldly sense, 'throwing away his prospects;' and this voice, real
in its time, would naturally be conventionalised. It would put on
the stock costume of devils and angels; and among Jewish christians
it would naturally be associated with the forty-days' fast of Moses
(Exod. xxxiv. 28; Deut. ix. 9), and that of Elias (1 Kings xix. 8),
and the forty-years' trial of Israel in the wilderness. Among Greek
christians some traces of the legend of Herakles in his seclusion as
herdsman, or at the cross-roads between Vice and Virtue, might enter;
and it is not impossible that some touches might be added from the
Oriental myth which invested Buddha.

However this may be, we may with certainty repair to the common
source of all such myths in the higher nature of man, and recognise
the power of a pure genius to overcome those temptations to a success
unworthy of itself. We may interpret all such legends with a clearness
proportioned to the sacrifices we have made for truth and ideal right;
and the endless perplexities of commentators and theologians about
the impossible outward details of the New Testament story are simple
confessions that the great spirit so tried is now made to label with
his name his own Tempter--namely, a Church grown powerful and wealthy,
which, as the Prince of this World, bribes the conscience and tempts
away the talent necessary to the progress of mankind.







CHAPTER XVIII.

TRIAL OF THE GREAT.

A 'Morality' at Tours--The 'St. Anthony' of Spagnoletto--Bunyan's
Pilgrim--Milton on Christ's Temptation--An Edinburgh saint and
Unitarian fiend--A haunted Jewess--Conversion by fever--Limit of
courage--Woman and sorcery--Luther and the Devil--The ink-spot at

trial--In Rue St. Thomas d'Enfer--The Everlasting No--Devil of
Vauvert--The latter-day conflict--New conditions--The Victory of
Man--The Scholar and the World.


A representation of the Temptation of St. Anthony (marionettes), which
I witnessed at Tours (1878), had several points of significance. It
was the mediaeval 'Morality' as diminished by centuries, and
conventionalised among those whom the centuries mould in ways and
for ends they know not. Amid a scenery of grotesque devils, rudely
copied from Callot, St. Anthony appeared, and was tempted in a way
that recalled the old pictures. There was the same fair Temptress, in
this case the wife of Satan, who warns her lord that his ugly devils
will be of no avail against Anthony, and that the whole affair should
be confided to her. She being repelled, the rest of the performance
consisted in the devils continually ringing the bell of the hermitage,
and finally setting fire to it. This conflagration was the supreme
torment of Anthony--and, sooth to say, it was a fairly comfortable
abode--who utters piteous prayers and is presently comforted by an
[[angel]] bringing him wreaths of evergreen.

The prayers of the saint and the response of the [[angel]] were meant to
be seriously taken; but their pathos was generally met with pardonable
laughter by the crowd in the booth. Yet there was a pathos about it
all, if only this, that the only temptations thought of for a saint
were a sound and quiet house and a mistress. The bell-noise alone
remained from the great picture of Spagnoletto at Siena, where the
unsheltered old man raises his deprecating hand against the disturber,
but not his eyes from the book he reads. In Spagnoletto's picture
there are five large books, pen, ink, and hour-glass; but there is
neither hermitage to be burnt nor female charms to be resisted.

But Spagnoletto, even in his time, was beholding the vision of
exceptional men in the past, whose hunger and thirst was for knowledge,
truth, and culture, and who sought these in solitude. Such men have
so long left the Church familiar to the French peasantry that any
representation of their temptations and trials would be out of place
among the marionettes. The bells which now disturb them are those
that sound from steeples.

Another picture loomed up before my eyes over the puppet performance at
Tours, that which for Bunyan frescoed the walls of Bedford Gaol. There,
too, the old demons, giants, and devils took on grave and vast forms,
and reflected the trials of the Great Hearts who withstood the Popes
and Pagans, the armed political Apollyons and the Giant Despairs,
who could make prisons the hermitages of men born to be saviours of
the people.

Such were the temptations that Milton knew; from his own heart
came the pigments with which he painted the trial of Christ in the
wilderness. 'Set women in his eye,' said Belial:--


        Women, when nothing else, beguiled the heart
        Of wisest Solomon, and made him build,
        And made him bow to the gods of his wives.
            To whom quick answer Satan thus returned.
        Belial, in much uneven scale thou weigh'st
        All others by thyself....
        But he whom we attempt is wiser far
        Than Solomon, of more exalted mind,
        Made and set wholly on the accomplishment
        Of greatest things....
        Therefore with manlier objects we must try
        His constancy, with such as have more show
        Of worth, of honour, glory, and popular praise;
        Rocks whereon greatest men have oftest wrecked. [96]


The progressive ideas which Milton attributed to Satan have not
failed. That Celestial City which Bunyan found it so hard to reach
has now become a metropolis of wealth and fashion, and the trials
which once beset pilgrims toiling towards it are now transferred
to those who would pass beyond it to another city, seen from afar,
with temples of Reason and palaces of Justice.

The old phantasms have shrunk to puppets. The trials by personal
devils are relegated to the regions of insanity and disease. It is
everywhere a dance of puppets though on a cerebral stage. A lady well
known in Edinburgh related to me a terrible experience she had with
the devil. She had invited some of her relations to visit her for some
days; but these relatives were Unitarians, and, after they had gone,
having entered the room which they had occupied, she was seized by
the devil, thrown on the floor, and her back so strained that she had
to keep her bed for some time. This was to her 'the Unitarian fiend'
of which the Wesleyan Hymn-Book sang so long; but even the Wesleyans
have now discarded the famous couplet, and there must be few who would
not recognise that the old lady at Edinburgh merely had a tottering
body representing a failing mind.

I have just read a book in which a lady in America relates her trial
by the devil. This lady, in her girlhood, was of a christian family,
but she married a rabbi and was baptized into Judaism. After some years
of happy life a terrible compunction seized her; she imagined herself
lost for ever; she became ill. A christian (Baptist) minister and
his wife were the evil stars in her case, and with what terrors they
surrounded the poor Jewess may be gathered from the following extract.

'She then left me--that dear friend left me alone to my God, and to
him I carried a lacerated and bleeding heart, and laid it at the foot
of the cross, as an atonement for the multiplied sins I had committed,
whether of ignorance or wilfulness; and how shall I proceed to portray
the heart-felt agonies of that night preceding my deliverance from
the shafts of Satan? Oh! this weight, this load of sin, this burden
so intolerable that it crushed me to the earth; for this was a
dark hour with me--the darkest; and I lay calm, to all appearance,
but with cold perspiration drenching me, nor could I close my eyes;
and these words again smote my ear, No redemption, no redemption; and
the tempter came, inviting me, with all his blandishment and power,
to follow him to his court of pleasure. My eyes were open; I certainly
saw him, dressed in the most phantastic shape. This was no illusion;
for he soon assumed the appearance of one of the gay throng I had
mingled with in former days, and beckoned me to follow. I was awake,
and seemed to lie on the brink of a chasm, and spirits were dancing
around me, and I made some slight outcry, and those dear girls watching
with me came to me, and looked at me. They said I looked at them but
could not speak, and they moistened my lips, and said I was nearly
gone; then I whispered, and they came and looked at me again, but
would not disturb me. It was well they did not; for the power of God
was over me, and angels were around me, and whispering spirits near,
and I whispered in sweet communion with them, as they surrounded me,
and, pointing to the throne of grace, said, 'Behold!' and I felt that
the glory of God was about to manifest itself; for a shout, as if a
choir of angels had tuned their golden harps, burst forth in, 'Glory
to God on high,' and died away in softest strains of melody. I lifted
up my eyes to heaven, and there, so near as to be almost within my
reach, the brightest vision of our Lord and Saviour stood before me,
enveloped with a light, ethereal mist, so bright and yet transparent
that his divine figure could be seen distinctly, and my eyes were
riveted upon him; for this bright vision seemed to touch my bed,
standing at the foot, so near, and he stretched forth his left hand
toward me, whilst with the right one he pointed to the throne of grace,
and a voice came, saying, 'Blessed are they who can see God; arise,
take up thy cross and follow me; for though thy sins be as scarlet
they shall be white as wool.' And with my eyes fixed on that bright
vision, I saw from the hand stretched toward me great drops of blood,
as if from each finger; for his blessed hand was spread open, as if
in prayer, and those drops fell distinctly, as if upon the earth;
and a misty light encircled me, and a voice again said, 'Take up thy
cross and follow me; for though thy sins be as scarlet they shall be
white as wool.' And angels were all around me, and I saw the throne
of heaven. And, oh! the sweet calm that stole over my senses. It
must have been a foretaste of heavenly bliss. How long I lay after
this beautiful vision I know not; but when I opened my eyes it was
early dawn, and I felt so happy and well. My young friends pressed
around my bedside, to know how I felt, and I said, 'I am well and so
happy.' They then said I was whispering with some one in my dreams
all night. I told them angels were with me; that I was not asleep,
and I had sweet communion with them, and would soon be well.' [97]

That is what the temptation of Jesus in the wilderness comes to when
dislocated from its time and place, and, with its gathered ages of
fable, is imported at last to be an engine of torture sprung on the
nerves of a devout woman. This Jewess was divorced from her husband
by her Christianity; her child died a victim to precocious piety;
but what were home and affection in ruins compared with salvation
from that frightful devil seen in her holy delirium?

History shows that it has always required unusual courage for a human
being to confront an enemy believed to be praeternatural. This Jewess
would probably have been able to face a tiger for the sake of her
husband, but not that fantastic devil. Not long ago an English actor
was criticised because, in playing Hamlet, he cowered with fear on
seeing the ghost, all his sinews and joints seeming to give way;
but to me he appeared then the perfect type of what mankind have
always been when believing themselves in the presence of praeternatural
powers. The limit of courage in human nature was passed when the foe
was one which no earthly power or weapon could reach.

In old times, nearly all the sorcerers and witches were women; and
it may have been, in some part, because woman had more real courage
than man unarmed. Sorcery and witchcraft were but the so-called
pagan rites in their last degradation, and women were the last to
abandon the declining religion, just as they are the last to leave
the superstition which has followed it. Their sentiment and affection
were intertwined with it, and the threats of eternal torture by devils
which frightened men from the old faith to the new were less powerful
to shake the faith of women. When pagan priests became christians,
priestesses remained, to become sorceresses. The new faith had
gradually to win the love of the sex too used to martyrdom on earth
to fear it much in hell. And now, again, when knowledge clears away
the old terrors, and many men are growing indifferent to all religion,
because no longer frightened by it, we may expect the churches to be
increasingly kept up by women alone, simply because they went into them
more by attraction of saintly ideals than fear of diabolical menaces.

Thomas Carlyle has selected Luther's boldness in the presence of what
he believed the Devil to illustrate his valour. 'His defiance of the
'Devils' in Worms,' says Carlyle, 'was not a mere boast, as the like
might be if spoken now. It was a faith of Luther's that there were
Devils, spiritual denizens of the Pit, continually besetting men. Many
times, in his writings, this turns up; and a most small sneer has
been grounded on it by some. In the room of the Wartburg, where he sat
translating the Bible, they still show you a black spot on the wall;
the strange memorial of one of these conflicts. Luther sat translating
one of the Psalms; he was worn down with long labour, with sickness,
abstinence from food; there rose before him some hideous indefinable
Image, which he took for the Evil One, to forbid his work; Luther
started up with fiend-defiance; flung his inkstand at the spectre,
and it disappeared! The spot still remains there; a curious monument
of several things. Any apothecary's apprentice can now tell us what we
are to think of this apparition, in a scientific sense; but the man's
heart that dare rise defiant, face to face, against Hell itself, can
give no higher proof of fearlessness. The thing he will quail before
exists not on this earth nor under it--fearless enough! 'The Devil
is aware,' writes he on one occasion, 'that this does not proceed
out of fear in me. I have seen and defied innumerable Devils. Duke
George,'--of Leipzig, a great enemy of his,--'Duke George is not equal
to one Devil,' far short of a Devil! 'If I had business at Leipzig,
I would ride into Leipzig, though it rained Duke Georges for nine
days running.' What a reservoir of Dukes to ride into!' [98]

Although Luther's courage certainly appears in this, it is plain that
his Devil was much humanised as compared with the fearful phantoms
of an earlier time. Nobody would ever have tried an inkstand on the
Gorgons, Furies, Lucifers of ancient belief. In Luther's Bible the
Devil is pictured as a monk--a lean monk, such as he himself was only
too likely to become if he continued his rebellion against the Church
(Fig. 17). It was against a Devil liable to resistance by physical
force that he hurled his inkstand, and against whom he also hurled
the contents of his inkstand in those words which Richter said were
half-battles.

Luther's Devil, in fact, represents one of the last phases in
the reduction of the Evil Power from a personified phantom with
which no man could cope, to that impersonal but all the more real
moral obstruction with which every man can cope--if only with
an inkstand. The horned monster with cowl, beads, and cross, is a
mere transparency, through which every brave heart may recognise the
practical power of wrong around him, the established error, disguised
as religion, which is able to tempt and threaten him.

The temptations with menace described--those which, coming upon
the weak nerves of women, vanquished their reason and heart; that
which, in a healthy man, raised valour and power--may be taken as
side-lights for a corresponding experience in the life of a great
man now living--Carlyle himself. It was at a period of youth when,
amid the lonely hills of Scotland, he wandered out of harmony with the
world in which he lived. Consecrated by pious parents to the ministry,
he had inwardly renounced every dogma of the Church. With genius and
culture for high work, the world demanded of him low work. Friendless,
alone, poor, he sat eating his heart, probably with little else to
eat. Every Scotch parson he met unconsciously propounded to that youth
the question whether he could convert his heretical stone into bread,
or precipitate himself from the pinnacle of the Scotch Kirk without
bruises? Then it was he roamed in his mystical wilderness, until he
found himself in the gayest capital of the world, which, however,
on him had little to bestow but a further sense of loneliness.

'Now, when I look back, it was a strange isolation I then lived
in. The men and women around me, even speaking with me, were but
Figures; I had practically forgotten that they were alive, that they
were not merely automatic. In the midst of their crowded streets and
assemblages, I walked solitary; and (except as it was my own heart,
not another's, that I kept devouring) savage also, as is the tiger in
his jungle. Some comfort it would have been, could I, like a Faust,
have fancied myself tempted and tormented of a Devil; for a Hell,
as I imagine, without Life, though only diabolic Life, were more
frightful: but in our age of Downpulling and Disbelief, the very Devil
has been pulled down--you cannot so much as believe in a Devil. To
me the Universe was all void of Life, of Purpose, of Volition, even
of Hostility: it was one huge, dead, immeasurable, Steam-engine,
rolling on, in its dead indifference, to grind me limb from limb. Oh,
the vast gloomy, solitary Golgotha, and Mill of Death! Why was the
Living banished thither, companionless, conscious? Why, if there is
no Devil; nay, unless the Devil is your God?' ...

'From suicide a certain aftershine of Christianity withheld me.' ...

'So had it lasted, as in bitter, protracted Death-agony, through
long years. The heart within me, unvisited by any heavenly dewdrop,
was smouldering in sulphurous, slow-consuming fire. Almost since
earliest memory I had shed no tear; or once only when I, murmuring
half-audibly, recited Faust's Deathsong, that wild Selig der den er
im Siegesglanze findet (Happy whom he finds in Battle's splendour),
and thought that of this last Friend even I was not forsaken, that
Destiny itself could not doom me not to die. Having no hope, neither
had I any definite fear, were it of Man or of Devil; nay, I often
felt as if it might be solacing could the Arch-Devil himself, though
in Tartarean terrors, rise to me that I might tell him a little of my
mind. And yet, strangely enough, I lived in a continual, indefinite,
pining fear; tremulous, pusillanimous, apprehensive of I knew not what;
it seemed as if all things in the Heavens above and the Earth beneath
would hurt me; as if the Heavens and the Earth were but boundless jaws
of a devouring monster, wherein I, palpitating, waited to be devoured.

'Full of such humour, and perhaps the miserablest man in the whole
French Capital or Suburbs, was I, one sultry Dogday, after much
perambulation, toiling along the dirty little Rue Sainte Thomas
de l'Enfer, among civic rubbish enough, in a close atmosphere, and
over pavements hot as Nebuchadnezzar's Furnace; whereby doubtless my
spirits were little cheered; when all at once there rose a Thought
in me, and I asked myself, 'What art thou afraid of? Wherefore, like
a coward, dost thou for ever pip and whimper, and go cowering and
trembling? Despicable biped! what is the sum-total of the worst that
lies before thee? Death? Well, Death; and say the pangs of Tophet too,
and all that the Devil or Man may, will, or can do against thee! Hast
thou not a heart; canst thou not suffer whatsoever it be; and, as a
Child of Freedom, though outcast, trample Tophet itself under thy feet,
while it consumes thee! Let it come, then; I will meet it and defy
it!' And as I so thought, there rushed like a stream of fire over my
whole soul; and I shook base Fear away from me for ever. I was strong,
of unknown strength; a spirit, almost a god. Ever from that time the
temper of my misery was changed: not Fear or whining Sorrow was it,
but Indignation and grim fire-eyed Defiance.

'Thus had the Everlasting No pealed authoritatively through all the
recesses of my Being, of my Me; and then was it that my whole Me
stood up, in native God-created majesty and with emphasis recorded
its Protest. Such a Protest, the most important transaction in Life,
may that same Indignation and Defiance, in a psychological point of
view, be fitly called. The Everlasting No had said, 'Behold thou
art fatherless, outcast, and the Universe is mine (the Devil's);'
to which my whole Me now made answer, 'I am not thine, but Free,
and for ever hate thee!'

'It is from this hour that I incline to date my spiritual New Birth,
or Baphometic fire-baptism; perhaps I directly thereupon began to be
a Man.' [99]

Perhaps he who so uttered his Apage Satana did not recognise amid
what haunted Edom he wrestled with his Phantom. Saint Louis, having
invited the Carthusian monks to Paris, assigned them a habitation in
the Faubourg Saint-Jacques, near the ancient chateau of Vauvert,
a manor built by Robert (le Diable), but for a long time then
uninhabited, because infested by demons, which had, perhaps, been
false coiners. Fearful howls had been heard there, and spectres seen,
dragging chains; and, in particular, it was frequented by a fearful
green monster, serpent and man in one, with a long white beard,
wielding a huge club, with which he threatened all who passed that
way. This demon, in common belief, passed along the road to and
from the chateau in a fiery chariot, and twisted the neck of every
human being met on his way. He was called the Devil of Vauvert. The
Carthusians were not frightened by these stories, but asked Louis to
give them the Manor, which he did, with all its dependencies. After
that nothing more was heard of the Diable Vauvert or his imps. It
was but fair to the Demons who had assisted the friars in obtaining a
valuable property so cheaply that the street should thenceforth bear
the name of Rue d'Enfer, as it does. But the formidable genii of the
place haunted it still, and, in the course of time, the Carthusians
proved that they could use with effect all the terrors which the
Devils had left behind them. They represented a great money-coining
Christendom with which free-thinking Michaels had to contend, even
to the day when, as we have just read, one of the bravest of these
there encountered his Vauvert devil and laid him low for ever.

I well remember that wretched street of St. Thomas leading into Hell
Street, as if the Parisian authorities, remembering that Thomas
was a doubter, meant to remind the wayfarer that whoso doubteth
is damned. Near by is the convent of St. Michael, who makes no war
on the neighbouring Rue Dragon. All names--mere idle names! Among
the thousands that crowd along them, how many pause to note the
quaintness of the names on the street-lamps, remaining there from
fossil fears and phantom battles long turned to fairy lore. Yet amid
them, on that sultry day, in one heart, was fought and won a battle
which summed up all their sense and value. Every Hell was conquered
then and there when Fear was conquered. There, when the lower Self
was cast down beneath the poised spear of a Free Mind, St. Michael at
last chained his dragon. There Luther's inkstand was not only hurled,
but hit its mark; there, 'Get thee behind me,' was said, and obeyed;
there Buddha brought the archfiend Mara to kneel at his feet.

And it was by sole might of a Man. Therefore may this be emphasised
as the temptation and triumph which have for us to-day the meaning
of all others.

A young man of intellectual power, seeing beyond all the conventional
errors around him, without means, feeling that ordinary work, however
honourable, would for him mean failure of his life--because failure
to contribute his larger truth to mankind--he finds the terrible
cost of his aim to be hunger, want, a life passed amid suspicion
and alienation, without sympathy, lonely, unloved--and, alas! with a
probability that all these losses may involve loss of just what they
are incurred for, the power to make good his truth. After giving up
love and joy, he may, after all, be unable to give living service
to his truth, but only a broken body and shed blood. Similar trials
in outer form have been encountered again and again; not only in
the great temptations and triumphs of sacred tradition, but perhaps
even more genuinely in the unknown lives of many pious people all
over the world, have hunger, want, suffering, been conquered by
faith. But rarely amid doubts. Rarely in the way of Saint Thomas,
in no fear of hell or devil, nor in any hope of reward in heaven, or
on earth; rarely indeed without any feeling of a God taking notice,
or belief in angels waiting near, have men or women triumphed utterly
over self. All history proves what man can sacrifice on earth for an
eternal weight of glory above. We know how cheerfully men and women
can sing at the stake, when they feel the fire consuming them to be
a chariot bearing them to heaven. We understand the valour of Luther
marching against his devils with his hymn, 'Ein feste Burg ist unser
Gott.' But it is important to know what man's high heart is capable of
without any of these encouragements or aids, what man's moral force
when he feels himself alone. For this must become an increasingly
momentous consideration.

Already the educated youth of our time have followed the wanderer
of threescore years ago into that St. Thomas d'Enfer Street, which
may be morally translated as the point where man doubts every hell
he does not feel, and every creed he cannot prove. The old fears
and hopes are fading faster from the minds around us than from
their professions. There must be very few sane people now who are
restrained by fear of hell, or promises of future reward. What then
controls human passion and selfishness? For many, custom; for others,
hereditary good nature and good sense; for some, a sense of honour;
for multitudes, the fear of law and penalties. It is very difficult
indeed, amid these complex motives, to know how far simple human
nature, acting at its best, is capable of heroic endurance for truth,
and of pure passion for the right. This cannot be seen in those
who intellectually reject the creed of the majority, but conform to
its standards and pursue its worldly advantages. It must be seen,
if at all, in those who are radically severed from the conventional
aims of the world,--who seek not its wealth, nor its honours, decline
its proudest titles, defy its authority, share not its prospects for
time or eternity. It must be proved by those, the grandeur of whose
aims can change the splendours of Paris to a wilderness. These may
show what man, as man, is capable of, what may be his new birth,
and the religion of his simple manhood. What they think, say, and
do is not prescribed either by human or supernatural command; in
them you do not see what society thinks, or sects believe, or what
the populace applaud. You see the individual man building his moral
edifice, as genuinely as birds their nests, by law of his own moral
constitution. It is a great thing to know what those edifices are,
for so at last every man will have to build if he build at all. And if
noble lives cannot be so lived, we may be sure the career of the human
race will be downhill henceforth. For any unbiassed mind may judge
whether the tendency of thought and power lies toward or away from
the old hopes and fears on which the regime of the past was founded.

A great and wise Teacher of our time, who shared with Carlyle his
lonely pilgrimage, has admonished his generation of the temptations
brought by talent,--selfish use of it for ambitious ends on the
one hand, or withdrawal into fruitless solitude on the other; and I
cannot forbear closing this chapter with his admonition to his young
countrymen forty years ago. [100]

'Public and private avarice makes the air we breathe thick and fat. The
scholar is decent, indolent, complacent. See already the tragic
consequence. The mind of this country, taught to aim at low objects,
eats upon itself. There is no work for any but the decorous and the
complacent. Young men of the fairest promise, who begin life upon our
shores, inflated by the mountain winds, shined upon by all the stars of
God, find the earth below not in unison with these,--but are hindered
from action by the disgust which the principles on which business is
managed inspire and turn drudges, or die of disgust,--some of them
suicides. What is the remedy? They did not yet see, and thousands of
young men as hopeful, now crowding to the barriers for the career,
do not yet see, that if the single man plant himself indomitably on
his instincts, and there abide, the huge world will come round to
him. Patience--patience;--with the shades of all the good and great
for company; and for solace, the perspective of your own infinite
life; and for work, the study and the communication of principles,
the making those instincts prevalent, the conversion of the world. Is
it not the chief disgrace in the world--not to be an unit; not to
be reckoned one character; not to yield that peculiar fruit which
each man was created to bear,--but to be reckoned in the gross, in
the hundred, in the thousand of the party, the section, to which we
belong; and our opinion predicted geographically, as the north or the
south? Not so, brothers and friends,--please God, ours shall not be
so. We will walk on our own feet; we will work with our own hands;
we will speak our own minds.'







CHAPTER XIX.

THE MAN OF SIN.

Hindu myth--Gnostic theories--Ophite scheme of
redemption--Rabbinical traditions of primitive man--Pauline
Pessimism--Law of death--Satan's ownership of man--Redemption of
the elect--Contemporary statements--Baptism--Exorcism--The 'new
man's' food--Eucharist--Herbert Spencer's explanation--Primitive
ideas--Legends of Adam and Seth--Adamites--A Mormon 'Mystery'
of initiation.


In a Hindu myth, Dhrubo, an infant devotee, passed much time in a
jungle, surrounded by ferocious beasts, in devotional exercises of
such extraordinary merit that Vishnu erected a new heaven for him
as the reward of his piety. Vishnu even left his own happy abode
to superintend the construction of this special heaven. In Hebrew
mythology the favourite son, the chosen people, is called out of
Egypt to dwell in a new home, a promised land, not in heaven but on
earth. The idea common to the two is that of a contrast between a
natural and a celestial environment,--a jungle and beasts, bondage
and distress; a new heaven, a land flowing with milk and honey,--and
the correspondence with these of the elect child, Dhrubo or Israel.

The tendency of Christ's mind appears to have been rather in the Aryan
direction; he pointed his friends to a kingdom not of this world,
and to his Father's many mansions in heaven. But the Hebrew faith in a
messianic reign in this world was too strong for his dream; a new earth
was appended to the new heaven, and became gradually paramount, but
this new earth was represented only by the small society of believers
who made the body of Christ, the members in which his blood flowed.

That great cauldron of confused superstitions and mysticisms which the
Roman Empire became after the overthrow of Jerusalem, formed a thick
scum which has passed under the vague name of Gnosticism. The primitive
notions of all races were contained in it, however, and they gathered
in the second and third centuries a certain consistency in the system
of the Ophites. In the beginning existed Bythos (the Depth); his first
emanation and consort is Ennoia (Thought); their first daughter is
Pneuma (Spirit), their second Sophia (Wisdom). Sophia's emanations are
two--one perfect, Christos; the other imperfect, Sophia-Achamoth,--who
respectively guide all that proceed from God and all that proceed
from Matter. Sophia, unable to act directly upon anything so gross
as Matter or unordered as Chaos, employs her imperfect daughter
Sophia-Achamoth for that purpose. But she, finding delight in imparting
life to inert Matter, became ambitious of creating in the abyss a
world for herself. To this end she produced the Demiurgus Ildabaoth
(otherwise Jehovah) to be creator of the material world. After this
Sophia-Achamoth shook off Matter, in which she had become entangled;
but Ildabaoth ('son of Darkness') proceeded to produce emanations
corresponding to those of Bythos in the upper universe. Among his
creations was Man, but his man was a soulless monster crawling on the
ground. Sophia-Achamoth managed to transfer to Man the small ray of
divine light which Ildabaoth had inherited from her. The 'primitive
Man' became thus a divine being. Ildabaoth, now entirely evil, was
enraged at having produced a being who had become superior to himself,
and his envy took shape in a serpent-formed Satan, Ophiomorphos. He
is the concentration of all that is most base in Matter, conjoined
with a spiritual intelligence. Their anti-Judaism led the Ophites to
identify Ildabaoth as Jehovah, and this serpent-son of his as Michael;
they also called him Samael. Ildabaoth then also created the animal,
vegetable, and mineral kingdoms, with all their evils. Resolving
to confine man within his own lower domain, he forbade him to eat
of the Tree of Knowledge. To defeat his scheme, which had all been
evolved out of her own temporary fall, Sophia-Achamoth sent her own
genius, also in form of a serpent, Ophis, to induce Man to transgress
the tyrant's command. Eve supposing Ophis the same as Ophiomorphos,
regarded the prohibition against the fruit as withdrawn and readily
ate of it. Man thus became capable of understanding heavenly
mysteries, and Ildabaoth made haste to imprison him in the dungeon
of Matter. He also punished Ophis by making him eat dust, and this
heavenly serpent, contaminated by Matter, changed from Man's friend
to his foe. Sophia-Achamoth has always striven against these two
Serpents, who bind man to the body by corrupt desires; she supplied
mankind with divine light, through which they became sensible of
their nakedness--the misery of their condition. Ildabaoth's seductive
agents gained control over all the offspring of Adam except Seth, type
of the Spiritual Man. Sophia-Achamoth moved Bythos to send down her
perfect brother Christos to aid the Spiritual Race of Seth. Christos
descended through the seven planetary regions, assuming successively
forms related to each, and entered into the man Jesus at the moment
of his baptism. Ildabaoth, discovering him, stirred up the Jews to
put him to death; but Christos and Sophia, abandoning the material
body of Jesus on the cross, gave him one made of ether. Hence his
mother and disciples could not recognise him. He ascended to the
Middle Space, where he sits by the right hand of Ildabaoth, though
unperceived by the latter, and, putting forth efforts for purification
of mankind corresponding to those put forth by Ildabaoth for evil,
he is collecting all the Spiritual elements of the world into the
kingdom which is to overthrow that of the Enemy. [101]

Notwithstanding the animosity shown by the Ophites towards the
Jews, most of the elements in their system are plagiarised from the
Jews. According to ancient rabbinical traditions, Adam and Eve, by
eating the fruit of the lowest region, fell through the six regions
to the seventh and lowest; they were there brought under control of
the previously fallen Samael, who defiled them with his spittle. Their
nakedness consisted in their having lost a natural protection of which
only our finger-nails are left; others say they lost a covering of
hair. [102] The Jews also from of old contended that Seth was the
son of Adam, in whom returned the divine nature with which man was
originally endowed. We have, indeed, only to identify Ildabaoth with
Elohim instead of Jehovah to perceive that the Ophites were following
Jewish precedents in attributing the natural world to a fiend. The link
between, the two conceptions may be discovered in the writings of Paul.

Paul's pessimistic conception of this world and of human nature was
radical, and it mainly formed the mould in which dogmatic Christianity
subsequently took shape. His general theology is a travesty of the
creation of the world and of man. All that work of Elohim was, by
implication, natural, that is to say, diabolical. The earth as then
created belonged to the Prince of this world, who was the author of
sin, and its consequence, death. In Adam all die. The natural man is
enmity against God; he is of the earth earthy; his father is the devil;
he cannot know spiritual things. All mankind are born spiritually
dead. Christ is a new and diviner Demiurgos, engaged in the work of
producing a new creation and a new man. For his purpose the old law,
circumcision or uncircumcision, are of no avail or importance, but a
new creature. His death is the symbol of man's death to the natural
world, his resurrection of man's rising into a new world which mere
flesh and blood cannot inherit. As God breathed into Adam's nostrils
the breath of life, the Spirit breathes upon the elect of Christ a
new mind and new heart.

The 'new creature' must inhale an entirely new physical
atmosphere. When Paul speaks of 'the Prince of the Power of the Air,'
it must not be supposed that he is only metaphorical. On this, however,
we must dwell for a little.

'The air,' writes Burton in his 'Anatomy of Melancholy,' 'The air
is not so full of flies in summer as it is at all times of invisible
devils. They counterfeit suns and moons, and sit on ships' masts. They
cause whirlwinds of a sudden, and tempestuous storms, which though our
meteorologists generally refer to natural causes, yet I am of Bodine's
mind, they are more often caused by those aerial devils in their
several quarters. Cardan gives much information concerning them. His
father had one of them, an aerial devil, bound to him for eight and
twenty years; as Agrippa's dog had a devil tied to his collar. Some
think that Paracelsus had one confined in his sword pommel. Others
wear them in rings;' and so the old man runs on, speculating about
the mysterious cobwebs collected in the ceiling of his brain.

The atmosphere mentally breathed by Burton and his authorities was
indeed charged with invisible phantasms; and every one of them was in
its origin a genuine intellectual effort to interpret the phenomena
of nature. It is not wonderful that the ancients should have ascribed
to a diabolical source the subtle deaths that struck at them from
the air. A single breath of the invisible poison of the air might
lay low the strongest. Even after man had come to understand his
visible foes, the deadly animal or plant, he could only cower and
pray before the lurking power of miasma and infection, the power of
the air. The Tyndalls of a primitive time studied dust and disease,
and called the winged seeds of decay and death 'aerial devils,' and
prepared the way for Mephistopheles (devil of smells), as he in turn
for the bacterial demon of modern science.

There were not wanting theologic explanations why these malignant
beings should find their dwelling-place in the air. They had been
driven out of heaven. The etherial realm above the air was reserved
for the good. Of the demons the Hindus say, 'Their feet touch not the
ground.' 'What man of virtue is there,' said Titus to his soldiers,
'who does not know that those souls which are severed from their
fleshy bodies in battles by the sword are received by the aether--that
purest of elements--and joined to that company which are placed among
the stars; that they become gods, daemons, and propitious heroes,
and show themselves as such to their posterity afterwards?' [103]
Malignant spirits were believed to hold a more undisputed sway over
the atmosphere than over the earth, although our planet was mainly
in their power, and the subjects of the higher empire always a small
colony. [104] Moreover, there was a natural tendency of demons, which
originally represented earthly evils, when these were conquered by
human intelligence, to pass into the realm least accessible to science
or to control by man. The uncharted winds became their refuge.

This belief was general among the Christian Fathers, [105] lasted a
very long time even among the educated, and is still the teaching
of the Roman Catholic Church, as any one may see by reading the
authorised work of Mgr. Gaume on 'Holy Water' (p. 305). So long as
it was admitted among thinking people that the mind was as competent
to build facts upon theory as theories on fact, a great deal might
be plausibly said for this atmospheric diabolarchy. In the days
when witchcraft was first called in question, Glanvil argued 'that
since this little Spot is so thickly peopled in every Atome of it,
'tis weakness to think that all the vast spaces Above and hollows
under Ground are desert and uninhabited,' and he anticipated that,
as microscopic science might reveal further populations in places
seemingly vacant, it would necessitate the belief that the regions of
the upper air are inhabited. [106] Other learned men concluded that
the spirits that lodge there are such as are clogged with earthly
elements; the baser sort; dwelling in cold air, they would like to
inhabit the more sheltered earth. In repayment for broth, and various
dietetic horrors proffered them by witches, they enable them to pass
freely through their realm--the air.

Out of such intellectual atmosphere came Paul's sentence (Eph. ii. 2)
about 'the Prince of the Power of the Air.' It was a spiritualisation
of the existing aerial demonology. When Paul and his companions carried
their religious agitation into the centres of learning and wealth,
and brought the teachings of a Jew to confront the temples of Greece
and Rome, they found themselves unrelated to that great world. It had
another habit of mind and feeling, and the idea grew in him that it
was the spirits of the Satanic world counteracting the spirit sent on
earth from the divine world. This animated its fashions, philosophy,
science, and literature. He warns the Church at Ephesus that they
will need the whole armour of God, because they are wrestling not with
mere flesh and blood, but against the rulers of the world's darkness,
the evil spirits in high places--that is, in the Air.

As heirs of this new nature and new world, with its new atmosphere,
purchased and endowed by Christ, the Pauline theory further
presupposes, that the natural man, having died, is buried with
Christ in baptism, rises with him, and is then sealed to him by the
Holy Ghost. For a little time such must still bear about them their
fleshy bodies, but soon Christ shall come, and these vile bodies
shall be changed into his likeness; meanwhile they must keep their
bodies in subjection, even as Paul did, by beating it black and blue
(hypopiazo), and await their deliverance from the body of the dead
world they have left, but which so far is permitted to adhere to
them. This conception had to work itself out in myths and dogmas of
which Paul knew nothing. 'If any man come after me and hate not his
father and mother, and his own (natural) life also, he cannot be my
disciple.' The new race with which the new creation was in travail
was logically discovered to need a new Mother as well as a new
Father. Every natural mother was subjected to a stain that it might
be affirmed that only one mother was immaculate--she whose conception
was supernatural, not of the flesh. Marriage became an indulgence to
sin (whose purchase-money survives still in the marriage-fee). The
monastery and the nunnery represented this new ascetic kingdom;
that perilous word 'worldliness' was transmitted to be the source of
insanity and hypocrisy.

Happily, the common sense and sentiment of mankind have so steadily
and successfully won back the outlawed interests of life and the
world, that it requires some research into ecclesiastical archaeology
to comprehend the original significance of the symbols in which
it survives. The ancient rabbins limited the number of souls which
hang on Adam to 600,000, but the Christian theologians extended the
figures to include the human race. Probably even some orthodox people
may be scandalised at the idea of the fathers (Irenaeus, for example),
that, at the Fall, the human race became Satan's rightful property,
did they see it in the picture copied by Buslaef, from an ancient
Russian Bible, in possession of Count Uvarof. Adam gives Satan
a written contract for himself and his descendants (Fig. 7). And
yet, according to a recent statement, the Rev. Mr. Simeon recently
preached a sermon in the Church of St. Augustine, Kilburn, London,
'to prove that the ruler of the world is the devil. He stated that the
Creator of the world had given the control of the world to one of his
chief angels, Lucifer, who, however, had gone to grief, and done his
utmost to ruin the world. Since then the Creator and Lucifer had been
continually striving to checkmate each other. As Lucifer is still the
Prince of this world, it would seem that it is not he who has been
beaten yet.' [107] A popular preacher in America, Rev. Dr. Talmage,
states the case as follows:--

'I turn to the same old book, and I find out that the Son of Mary,
who was the Son of God, the darling of heaven, the champion of the
ages, by some called Lord, by some called Jesus, by others called
Christ, but this morning by us called by the three blessed titles,
Lord Jesus Christ, by one magnificent stroke made it possible for
us all to be saved. He not only told us that there was a hell, but
he went into it. He walked down the fiery steeps. He stepped off the
bottom rung of the long ladder of despair. He descended into hell. He
put his bare foot on the hottest coal of the fiercest furnace.

'He explored the darkest den of eternal midnight, and then He came
forth lacerated and scarified, and bleeding and mauled by the hands
of infernal excruciation, to cry out to all the ages, 'I have paid
the price for all those who would make me their substitute. By my
piled-up groans, by my omnipotent agony, I demand the rescue of all
those who will give up sin and trust in me,' Mercy! mercy! mercy! But
how am I to get it? Cheap. It will not cost you as much as a loaf of
bread. Only a penny? No, no. Escape from hell, and all the harps,
and mansions, and thrones, and sunlit fields of heaven besides in
the bargain, 'without money, and without price.''

These preachers are only stating with creditable candour the
original significance of the sacraments and ceremonies which were
the physiognomy of that theory of 'a new creature.' Following various
ancient traditions, that life was produced out of water, that water
escaped the primal curse on nature, that devils hate and fear it
because of this and the saltness of so much of it, many religions
have used water for purification and exorcism. [108] Baptism is
based on the notion that every child is offspring of the Devil,
and possessed of his demon; the Fathers agreed that all unbaptized
babes, even the still-born, are lost; and up to the year 1550 every
infant was subjected at baptism to the exorcism, 'I command thee,
unclean spirit, in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost, that thou come out, and depart from, these infants whom
our Lord Jesus Christ has vouchsafed to call to his holy baptism,
to be made members of his body and of his holy congregation,' &c.

A clergyman informed me that he knew of a case in which a man,
receiving back his child after christening, kissed it, and said,
'I never kissed it before, because I knew it was not a child of God;
but now that it is, I love it dearly.' But why not? Some even now teach
that a white [[angel]] follows the baptized, a black demon the unbaptized.

The belief was wide-spread that unbaptized children were turned into
elves at death. In Iceland it is still told as a bit of folk-lore,
that when God visited Eve, she kept a large number of her children
out of sight, 'because they had not been washed,' and these children
were turned into elves, and became the progenitors of that uncanny
race. The Greek Church made so much of baptism, that there has been
developed an Eastern sect which claims John the Baptist as its founder,
making little of Christ, who baptized none; and to this day in Russia
the peasant regards it as almost essential to a right reception of
the benedictions of Sunday to have been under water on the previous
day--soap being sagaciously added. The Roman Catholic Church, following
the provision of the Council of Carthage, still sets a high value on
baptismal exorcism; and Calvin refers to a theological debate at the
Sorbonne in Paris, whether it would not be justifiable for a priest to
throw a child into a well rather than have it die unbaptized. Luther
preserved the Catholic form of exorcism; and, in some districts of
Germany, Protestants have still such faith in it, that, when either
a child or a domestic animal is suspected of being possessed, they
will send for the Romish priest to perform the rite of exorcism.

Mr. Herbert Spencer has described the class of superstitions out of
which the sacrament of the Eucharist has grown. 'In some cases,' he
says, 'parts of the dead are swallowed by the living, who seek thus
to inspire themselves with the good qualities of the dead; and we saw
( 133) that the dead are supposed to be honoured by this act. The
implied notion was supposed to be associated with the further notion
that the nature of another being, inhering in all the fragments of
his body, inheres too in the unconsumed part of anything consumed
with his body; so that an operation wrought on the remnants of his
food becomes an operation wrought on the food swallowed, and therefore
on the swallower. Yet another implication is, that between those who
swallow different parts of the same food some community of nature is
established. Hence such beliefs as that ascribed by Bastian to some
negroes, who think that, 'on eating and drinking consecrated food,
they eat and drink the god himself'--such god being an ancestor, who
has taken his share. Various ceremonies among savages are prompted
by this conception; as, for instance, the choosing a totem. Among
the Mosquito Indians, 'the manner of obtaining this guardian was
to proceed to some secluded spot and offer up a sacrifice: with
the beast or bird which thereupon appeared, in dream or in reality,
a compact for life was made, by drawing blood from various parts of
the body.' This blood, supposed to be taken by the chosen animal,
connected the two, and the animal's life became so bound up with their
own that the death of one involved that of the other.' [109] And now
mark that, in these same regions, this idea reappears as a religious
observance. Sahagun and Herrera describe a ceremony of the Aztecs
called 'eating the god.' Mendieta, describing this ceremony, says,
'They had also a sort of eucharist.... They made a sort of small idols
of seeds, ... and ate them as the body or memory of their gods.' As
the seeds were cemented partly by the blood of sacrificed boys;
as their gods were cannibal gods; as Huitzilopochtli, whose worship
included this rite, was the god to whom human sacrifices were most
extensive; it is clear that the aim was to establish community with
gods by taking blood in common.' [110]

When, a little time ago, a New Zealand chief showed his high
appreciation of a learned German by eating his eyes to improve his
own intellectual vision, the case seemed to some to call for more
and better protected missionaries; but the chief might find in the
sacramental communion of the missionaries the real principle of his
faith. The celebration of the 'Lord's Supper' when a Bishop is ordained
has only to be 'scratched,' as the proverb says, to reveal beneath
it the Indians choosing their episcopal totem. As Israel observed
the Passover--eating together of the lamb whose blood sprinkled on
their door-posts had marked those to be preserved from the Destroying
[[Angel]] in Egypt--they who believed that Jesus was Messias tasted the
body and blood of their Head, as indicating the elect out of a world
otherwise given over to the Destroyer spiritually, and finally to be
delivered up to him bodily. 'He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my
blood dwelleth in me and I in him.' These were to tread on serpents,
or handle them unharmed, as it is said Paul did. They were not really
to die, but to fall asleep, that they might be changed as a seed to
its flower, through literal resurrection from the earth.

We should probably look in vain after any satisfactory vestiges of
the migration of the superstition concerning the mystical potency
of food. It is found fully developed in the ancient Hindu myth
of the struggle between the gods and demons for the Amrita, the
immortalising nectar, one stolen sip of which gave the monster Rahu
the imperishable nature which no other of his order possesses. It
is found in corresponding myths concerning the gods of [[Asgard]] and of
Olympus. The fall of man in the Iranian legend was through a certain
milk given by Ahriman to the first pair, Meschia and Meschiane. In
Buddhist mythology, it was eating rice that corrupted the nature
of man. It was the process of incarnation in the Gilghit legend
(i. 398). The whole story of Persephone turns upon her having
eaten the seed of a pomegranate in Hades, by which she was bound to
that sphere. There is a myth very similar to that of Persephone in
Japan. There is a legend in the Scottish Highlands that a woman was
conveyed into the secret recesses of the 'men of peace'--the Daoine
Shi', euphemistic name of uncanny beings, who carry away mortals to
their subterranean apartments, where beautiful damsels tempt them to
eat of magnificent banquets. This woman on her arrival was recognised
by a former acquaintance, who, still retaining some portion of human
benevolence, warned her that, if she tasted anything whatsoever for a
certain space of time, she would be doomed to remain in that underworld
for ever. The woman having taken this counsel, was ultimately restored
to the society of mortals. It was added that, when the period named by
her unfortunate friend had elapsed, a disenchantment of this woman's
eyes took place, and the viands which had before seemed so tempting
she now discovered to consist only of the refuse of the earth. [111]

The difficulty of tracing the ethnical origin of such legends as
these is much greater than that of tracing their common natural
origin. The effect of certain kinds of food upon the human system is
very marked, even apart from the notorious effects of the drinks made
from the vegetative world. The effects of mandrake, opium, tobacco,
various semi-poisonous fungi, the simplicity with which differences of
race might be explained by their vegetarian or carnivorous customs,
would be enough to suggest theories of the potency of food over the
body and soul of man such as even now have their value in scientific
speculation.

The Jewish opinion that Seth was the offspring of the divine part of
Adam was the germ of a remarkable christian myth. Adam, when dying,
desired Seth to procure the oil of mercy (for his extreme unction)
from the angels guarding Paradise. Michael informs Seth that it
can only be obtained after the lapse of the ages intervening the
Fall and the Atonement. Seth received, however, a small branch of
the Tree of Knowledge, and was told that when it should bear fruit,
Adam would recover. Returning, Seth found Adam dead, and planted the
branch in his grave. It grew to a tree which Solomon had hewn down
for building the temple; but the workmen could not adapt it, threw it
aside, and it was used as a bridge over a lake. The Queen of Sheba,
about to cross this lake, beheld a vision of Christ on the cross,
and informed Solomon that when a certain person had been suspended
on that tree the fall of the Jewish nation would be near. Solomon in
alarm buried the wood deep in the earth, and the spot was covered by
the pool of Bethesda. Shortly before the crucifixion the tree floated
on that water, and ultimately, as the cross, bore its fruit. [112]

In our old Russian picture (Fig. 8) Seth is shown offering a branch
of the Tree of Knowledge to his father Adam. That it should spring up
to be the Tree of Life is simply in obedience to Magian and Gnostic
theories, which generally turn on some scheme by which the Good turns
against the Evil Mind the point of his own weapon. These were the
influences which gave to christian doctrines on the subject their
perilous precision. The universal tradition was that Adam was the
first person liberated by Christ from hell; and this corresponded
with an equally wide belief that all who were saved by the death
of Christ and his descent into hell were at once raised into the
moral condition of Adam and Eve before the Fall,--to eat the food
and breathe the holy air of Paradise.

An honest mirror was held up before this theology by the christian
Adamites. Their movement (second and third centuries) was a most
legitimate outcome of the Pauline and Johannine gospel. The author of
this so-called 'heresy,' Prodicus, really anticipated the Methodist
doctrine of 'sanctification,' and he was only consistent in admonishing
his followers that clothing was, in the Bible, the original badge
of carnal guilt and shame, and was no longer necessary for those
whom Christ had redeemed from the Fall and raised to the original
innocence of Adam and Eve. These believers, in the appropriate
climate of Northern Africa, had no difficulty in carrying out their
doctrine practically, and having named their churches 'Paradises,'
assembled in them quite naked. There is still a superstition in
the East that a snake will never attack one who is naked. The same
Adamite doctrine--a prelapsarian perfection symbolised by nudity--was
taught by John Picard in Bohemia, and a flourishing sect of 'Adamites'
arose there in the fifteenth century. The Slavonian Adamites of the
last century--and they are known to carry on their services still in
secret--not only dispense with clothing, but also with sacraments and
ceremonies, which are for the imperfect, not for the perfected. Again
and again has this logical result of the popular theology appeared,
and with increasingly gross circumstances, as the refined and
intelligent abandon except in name the corresponding dogmas. It is
an impressive fact that Paul's central doctrine of 'a new creature'
is now adopted with most realistic orthodoxy by the Mormons of Utah,
whose initiation consists of a dramatic performance on each candidate
of moulding the body out of clay, breathing in the nostrils, the
'deep sleep' presentation of an Eve to each Adam, the temptation,
fall, and redemption. The 'saints' thus made, unfortunately, seem
to have equally realistic ideas that the Gentiles are adherents of
the Prince of this world, and their sacramental bands have shown some
striking imitations of those events of history which, when not labelled
'Christian,' are pronounced barbarous. Now that the old dogmatic system
is being left more and more to the ignorant and vulgar to make over
into their own image and likeness, it may be hoped that elsewhere also
the error that libels and outrages nature will run to seed; for error,
like the aloe, has its period when it shoots up a high stem and--dies.







CHAPTER XX.

THE HOLY GHOST.

A Hanover relic--Mr. Atkinson on the Dove--The Dove in the Old
Testament--Ecclesiastical symbol--Judicial symbol--A vision of
St. Dunstan's--The witness of chastity--Dove and Serpent--The
unpardonable sin--Inexpiable sin among the Jews--Destructive
power of Jehovah--Potency of the breath--Third persons of
Trinities--Pentecost--Christian superstitions--Mr. Moody on the
sin against the Holy Ghost--Mysterious fear--Idols of the cave.


There is in the old town of Hanover, in Germany, a schoolhouse
in which, above the teacher's chair, there was anciently the
representation of a dove perched upon an iron branch or rod; and
beneath the inscription--'This shall lead you into all truth.' In the
course of time the dove fell down and was removed to the museum; but
there is still left before the children the rod, with the admonition
that it will lead them into all truth. This is about as much as for
a long time was left in the average christian mind of the symbolical
Dove, the Holy Ghost. Half of its primitive sense departed, and there
remained only an emblem of mysterious terror. More spiritual minds
have introduced into the modern world a conception of the Holy Ghost
as a life-giving influence or a spirit of love, but the ancient view
which regarded it as the Iron Rod of judgment and execution still
survives in the notion of the 'sin against the Holy Ghost.'

Mr. Henry G. Atkinson writes as follows: [113]--'My old friend
Barry Cornwall, the fine poet, once said to me, 'My dear Atkinson,
can you tell me the meaning of the Holy Ghost; what can it possibly
mean?' 'Well,' I said, 'I suppose it means a pigeon. We have never
heard of it in any other form but that of the dove descending from
heaven to the Virgin Mary. Then we have the pretty fable of the dove
returning to the ark with the olive-branch, so that the Christian
religion may be called the Religion of the Pigeon. In the Greek Church
the pigeon is held sacred. St. Petersburgh is swarming with pigeons,
but they are never killed or disturbed. I knew a lady whose life
was made wretched in the belief that she had sinned the unpardonable
sin against the Holy Ghost, and neither priest nor physician could
persuade her out of the delusion, though in all other respects she
was quite sensible. She regarded herself as such a wretch that she
could not bear to see herself in the glass, and the looking-glasses
had all to be removed, and when she went to an hotel, her husband had
to go first and have the looking-glasses of the apartments covered
over. But what is the Holy Ghost--what is its office? Sitting with
Miss Martineau at her house at Ambleside one day, a German lady, who
spoke broken English, came in. She was a neighbour, and had a large
house and grounds, and kept fowls. 'Oh!' she said, quite excited,
'the beast has taken off another chicken (meaning the hawk). I saw
it myself. The wretch! it came down just like the Holy Ghost, and
snatched off the chicken.' How Miss Martineau did laugh; but I don't
know that this story throws much light upon the subject, since it
does but bring us back to the pigeon.'

It would require a volume to explain fully all the problems suggested
in this brief note, but the more important facts may be condensed.

It is difficult to show how far the natural characteristics and habits
of the dove are reflected in its wide-spread symbolism. Its plaintive
note and fondness for solitudes are indicated in the Psalmist's
aspiration, 'Oh that I had the wings of a dove, then would I fly
away and be at rest; lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in
the wilderness.' [114] It is not a difficult transition from this
association with the wilderness to investment with a relationship with
the demon of the wilderness--Azazel. So we find it in certain passages
in Jeremiah, where the word has been suppressed in the ordinary
English version. 'The land is desolate because of the fierceness
of the dove.' 'Let us go again to our own people to avoid the sword
of the dove.' 'They shall flee away every one for fear of the sword
of the dove.' [115] In India its lustres--blue and fiery--may have
connected it with azure-necked Siva.

The far-seeing and wonderful character of the pigeon as a carrier
was well known to the ancients. On Egyptian bas-reliefs priests are
shown sending them with messages. They appear in the branches of the
oaks of Dodona, and in old Russian frescoes they sometimes perch on
the Tree of Knowledge in paradise. It is said that, in order to avail
himself of this universal symbolism, Mohammed trained a dove to perch
on his shoulder. As the raven was said to whisper secrets to [[Odin]],
so the dove was often pictured at the ear of God. In Notre Dame de
Chartres, its beak is at the ear of Pope Gregory the Great.

It passed--and did not have far to go--to be the familiar of kings. It
brought the chrism from heaven at the baptism of Clovis. White
doves came to bear the soul of Louis of Thuringia to heaven. The
dove surmounted the sceptre of Charlemagne. At the consecration of
the kings of France, after the ceremony of unction, white doves were
let loose in the church. At the consecration of a monarch in England,
a duke bears before the sovereign the sceptre with the dove.

By association with both ecclesiastical and political sovereignty,
it came to represent very nearly the old fatal serpent power which
had lurked in all its transformations. When the Holy Ghost was
represented as a crowned man, the dove was pictured on his wrist like
that falcon with which the German lady, mentioned by Mr. Atkinson,
identified it. But in this connection its symbolism is more especially
referable to a passage in Isaiah: [116] 'There shall come forth a rod
out of the stem of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his roots;
and the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom
and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of the
knowledge and of the fear of the Lord.' The sanctity of the number
seven led to the partition of the last clause into three spirits,
making up the seven, which were: Wisdom, Understanding, Counsel,
Strength, Knowledge, Piety, Fear. In some of the representations
of these where each of the seven Doves is labelled with its name,
'Fear' is at the top of their arch, a Psalm having said, 'The fear
of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.' When the knightly Order
of the Holy Ghost was created in 1352, it was aristocratic, and,
when reorganised by Henry III. of France in 1579, it was restricted
to magisterial and political personages. With them was the spirit of
Fear certainly; and the Order shows plainly what had long been the
ideas connected with the Holy Ghost.

M. Didron finds this confirmed in the legends of every country, and
especially refers to a story of St. Dunstan, Archbishop of Canterbury,
in the tenth century. Three men, convicted of coining false money, had
been condemned to death. Immediately before the celebration of mass
on the day of Pentecost, the festival of the Holy Ghost, St. Dunstan
inquired whether justice had been done upon the three criminals:
he was informed in reply that the execution had been delayed on
account of the solemn feast of Pentecost then in celebration. 'It
shall not be thus,' cried the indignant archbishop, and gave orders
for the immediate execution of the guilty men. Several of those who
were present remonstrated against the cruelty of that order; it was
nevertheless obeyed.

After the execution of the criminals, Dunstan washed his face, and
turned with a joyful countenance towards his oratory. 'I now hope,'
said he, 'that God will be pleased to accept the sacrifice I am about
to offer;' and in fact, during the celebration of mass, at the moment
when the Saint raised his hands to implore that God the Father would
be pleased to give peace to his Church, to guide, guard, and keep
it in unity throughout the world, 'a dove, as white as snow, was
seen to descend from heaven, and during the entire service remained
with wings extended, floating silently in air above the head of the
archbishop.' [117]

The passionate sexual nature of the dove made it emblem of Aphrodite,
and it became spiritualised in its consecration to the Madonna. From
its relation to the falsely-accused Mary, there grew around the Dove
a special class of legends which show it attesting female innocence
or avenging it. The white dove said to have issued from the mouth
of Joan of Arc is one of many instances. There is still, I believe,
preserved in the Lyttleton family the picture painted by Dowager
Lady Lyttleton in 1780, in commemoration of the warning of death
given to Lord Lyttleton by the mother of two girls he had seduced,
the vision being attended by a fluttering dove. The original account
of his vision or dream, attributed to Lord Lyttleton, mentions only
'a bird.' When next told, it is that he 'heard a noise resembling the
fluttering of a dove,' and on looking to the window saw 'an unhappy
female whom he had seduced.' But the exigencies of orthodoxy are too
strong for original narratives. As the 'bird' attested an announcement
that on the third day (that too was gradually added) he would die,
it must have been a dove; and as the dove attends only the innocent,
it must have been the poor girl's mother that appeared. It was easy
to have the woman die at the precise hour of appearance. [118] When in
Chicago in 1875, I read in one of the morning papers a very particular
account of how a white dove flew into the chamber window of a young
unmarried woman in a neighbouring village, she having brought forth
a child, and solemnly declaring that she had never lost her virginity.

In this history of the symbolism of the Dove the theological
development of the Holy Ghost has been outlined. We have seen
in the previous chapter that the Holy Spirit is in opposition to
the Natural Air,--repository of evils. The Dove symbolised this
aspect of it in hovering over the world emerging from its diluvial
baptism, and also over the typical new Adam (Jesus) coming from his
baptism. But in this it corresponds with the serpent-symbol of life
in Egyptian mythology brooding over the primal mundane egg (as in
Fig. 23, vol. i.). Nathaniel Hawthorne found a mystical meaning in
the beautiful group at Rome representing a girl pressing a dove to
her bosom while she is attacked by a serpent. But in their theological
aspects the Dove and the Serpent blend; they are at once related and
separated in Christ's words, 'Be ye wise as serpents and harmless
as doves;' but in the office of the Holy Ghost as representing a
divine Intelligence, and its consequent evolution as executor of
divine judgments, it fulfils in Christendom much the same part as
the Serpent in the more primitive mythologies.

'Every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven unto men,' said a legendary
Christ; [119] 'but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be
forgiven. And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man,
it will be forgiven him, but whosoever shall speak against the Holy
Ghost, it will not be forgiven him, neither in this world nor in that
to come.' In Mark [120] it is said, 'All things shall be forgiven
unto the sons of men, the sins and the blasphemies wherewith they
shall blaspheme: but whosoever shall blaspheme against the Holy
Ghost has never forgiveness, but will be guilty of everlasting sin;
(because they said, He has an unclean spirit).' When Christ uttered
these tremendous words, no disciple seems to have been startled,
or to have inquired into the nature of that sin, so much worse than
any offence against himself or the Father, which has since employed
so much theological speculation.

In fact, they needed no explanation: it was an old story;
the unpardonable sin was a familiar feature of ancient Jewish
law. Therein the sin excluded from expiation was any presumptuous
language or action against Jehovah. It is easy to see why this was
so. Real offences, crimes against man or society, were certain of
punishment, through the common interest and need. But the honour
and interests of Jehovah, not being obvious or founded in nature,
required special and severe statutes. The less a thing is protected
by its intrinsic and practical importance, the more it must, if at
all, be artificially protected. This is illustrated in the story
of Eli and his two sons. These youths were guilty of the grossest
immoralities, but not a word was said against them, they being sons
of the High Priest, except a mild remonstrance from Eli himself. But
when on an occasion these youths tasted the part of the sacrificial
meat offered to Jehovah, the divine wrath was kindled. Eli, much more
terrified at this ceremonial than the moral offence, said to his sons,
'If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him, but if a
man sin against Jehovah, who shall entreat for him?' In protecting
his interests, Jehovah's destroying [[angel]] does not allude to any
other offence of Eli's sons except that against himself. But when the
priestly guardians of the divine interests came with their people under
the control of successive Gallios,--aliens who cared not for their
ceremonial law, and declined to permit the infliction of its penalties,
as England now forbids suttee in India,--the priests could only pass
sentences; execution of them had to be adjourned to a future world.

The doctrine of a future state of rewards and punishments is not one
which a priesthood would naturally prefer or invent. So long as a
priesthood possesses the power of life and death over the human body,
they would not, by suggesting future awards, risk the possibility
of a heresy arising to maintain Deorum injuria diis cura. But where
an alien jurisdiction has relegated to local deities the defence of
their own majesty, there must grow up the theory that such offences
as cannot be expiated on earth are unpardonable, and must, because
of the legal impunity with which they can be committed, be all the
more terribly avenged somewhere else.

Under alien influences, also, the supreme and absolute government of
Jehovah had been divided, as is elsewhere described. He who originally
claimed the empire of both light and darkness, good and evil, when
his rivalry against other gods was on a question of power, had to be
relieved of responsibility for earthly evils when the moral sense
demanded dualism. Thus there grew up a separate personification of
the destructive power of Jehovah, which had been supposed to lodge
in his breath. The last breath of man obviously ends life; there is
nothing more simple in its natural germ than the association of the
first breath and the last with the Creative Spirit. [121] This potency
of the breath or spirit is found in many ancient regions. It is the
natural teaching of the destructive simoom, [122] or even of the annual
autumnal breath which strikes the foliage with death. Persia especially
abounded with superstitions of this character. By a sorcerer's breath
the two serpents were evoked from the breast of Zohak. Nizami has woven
the popular notion into his story of the two physicians who tried to
destroy each other; one of whom survived his rival's poisonous draught,
and killed that rival by making him smell a flower on which he had
breathed. [123] Such notions as these influenced powerfully the later
development of the idea of Jehovah, concerning whom it was said of old,
'With the breath of his mouth shall he slay the wicked;' 'the breath
of the Lord like a stream of brimstone doth kindle (Tophet).'

Meanwhile in all the Trinitarian races which were to give form to
christian Mythology, destructiveness had generally (not invariably)
become the traditional role of the Third Person. [124] In Egypt there
were Osiris the Creator, Horus the Preserver, Typhon the Destroyer;
in Babylonia, Anu the Upper Air, Sin (Uri) the Moon, Samis the Sun. In
Assyria the Sun regains his place, and deadly influences were ascribed
to the Moon. In India, Brahma the Father, Vishnu the Saviour, Siva the
Destroyer; in Persia, Zeruane-Akrane Infinite Time, Ormuzd the Good,
Ahriman the Evil; in Greece Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades, or Heaven,
Ocean, and Hell, were the first-born of Time. The Trinitarian form had
gradually crept in among the Jews, though their Jahvistic theology only
admitted its application to inferior deities--Cain, Abel, Seth; Moses,
Aaron, Hur; Abraham, Isaac, Jacob. As time went on, these succeeded
the ideas of Jehovah, Messias, and Wisdom. But already the serpent
was the wisest of all the beasts of the field in Jewish mythology;
and the personified Wisdom was fully prepared to be identified with
Athena, the Greek Wisdom, who sprang armed from the head of Zeus
(the Air), and whose familiar was a serpent.

On the other hand, however, the divine Breath had also its benign
significance. Siva ('the auspicious') inherited the character of Rudra
('roaring storm'), but it was rather supported later on by his wife
Kali. Athena though armed was the goddess of agriculture. The breath
of Elohim had given man life. 'I now draw in and now let forth,'
says Krishna; [125] 'I am generation and dissolution; I am death
and immortality.' 'Thou wilt fancy it the dawning zephyr of an early
spring,' says Sadi; 'but it is the breath of Isa, or Jesus; for in
that fresh breath and verdure the dead earth is reviving.' [126]
'The voice of the turtle is heard in the land,' sings Solomon.

When the Third Person of the Christian Trinity was constituted,
it inherited the fatality of all the previous Third Persons--the
Destroyers--while it veiled them in mystery. When the Holy Ghost
inspired the disciples the account is significant. [127] 'Suddenly
there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind,
... and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire,
and it sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy
Ghost.' This was on the Day of Pentecost, the harvest festival, when
the first-fruits were offered to the quickening Spirit or Breath of
nature; but the destructive feature is there also--the tongues are
cloven like those of serpents. The beneficent power was manifest at
the gate called Beautiful when the lame man was made to walk by Peter's
power; but its fatal power was with the same apostle, and when he said,
'Why hath Satan filled thy heart to lie to the Holy Ghost?' instantly
Ananias fell down and gave up the ghost. [128] The spirit was carried,
it is said, in the breath of the apostles. Its awfulness had various
illustrations. Mary offered up two doves in token of her conception by
the Holy Ghost. Jesus is described as scourging from the temple those
that sold doves, and the allegory is repeated in Peter's denunciation
of Simon Magus, who offered money for the gift of the Holy Ghost. [129]

In one of his sermons Mr. Moody said, 'Nearly every day we have
somebody coming into the inquiry-room very much discouraged and
disheartened and cast down, because they think they have committed
a sin against the Holy Ghost, and that there is no hope for
them.' Mr. Moody said he believed the sin was nearly impossible, but
he adds this remarkable statement, 'I don't remember of ever hearing
a man swear by the Holy Ghost except once, and then I looked upon
him expecting him to fall dead, and my blood ran cold when I heard
him.' But it is almost as rare to hear prayers addressed to the Holy
Ghost; and both phenomena--for praying and swearing are radically
related--are no doubt survivals of the ancient notions which I
have described. The forces of nature out of which the symbol grew,
the life that springs from death and grows by decay, is essentially
repeated again by those who adhere to the letter that kills, and
also by those who ascend with the spirit that makes alive. It is
probable that no more terrible form of the belief in a Devil survives
than this Holy Ghost Dogma, which, lurking in vagueness and mystery,
like the serpent of which it was born, passes by the self-righteous
to cast its shadows over the most sensitive and lowly minds, chiefly
those of pure women prone to exaggerate their least blemishes.

In right reason the fatal Holy Ghost stands as the type of that Fear
by which priesthoods have been able to preserve their institutions
after the deities around whom they grew had become unpresentable,
and which could best be fostered beneath the veil of mystery. They
who love darkness rather than light because their deeds cannot bear
the light, veil their gods not to abolish them but to preserve
them. Calvinism is veiled, and Athanasianism, and Romanism; they
are all veiled idols, whose power lives by being hid in a mass of
philology and casuistry. So long as Christianity can persuade the
Pope and Dr. Martineau, Dean Stanley and Mr. Moody, Quakers, Shakers,
Jumpers, all to describe themselves alike as 'Christians,' its real
nature will be veiled, its institutions will cumber the ground, and
draw away the strength and intellect due to humanity; the indefinable
'infidel' will be a devil. This process has been going on for a long
time. The serpent-god, accursed by the human mind which grew superior
to it, has crept into its Ark; but its fang and venom linger with that
Bishop breathing on a priest, the priest breathing on a sick child,
and bears down side by side with science that atmosphere of mystery
in which creep all the old reptiles that throttle common sense and
send their virus through all the social frame.

In demonology the Holy Ghost is not a Devil, but in it are reflected
the diabolisation of Culture and Progress and Art. It was these
'Devils' which compelled the gods to veil themselves through successive
ages, and to spiritualise their idols and dogmas to save their
institutions. The deities concealed have proved far more potent over
the popular imagination than when visible. The indefinable terrible
menace of the Holy Ghost was a consummate reply to that equally
indefinable spirit of loathing and contempt which rises among the
cultured and refined towards things that have become unreal, their
formalities and their cant. It is this ever-recurring necessity that
enables clergymen to denounce belief in Hell and a Devil in churches
which assuredly would never have been built but for the superstition
so denounced. The ancient beliefs and the present denunciation of them
are on the same thread,--the determination of a Church to survive and
hold its power at any and every cost. The jesuitical power to veil
the dogma is the most successful method of confronting the Spirit
of an Age, which in the eye of reason is the only holy spirit, but
which to ecclesiastical power struggling with enlightenment is the
only formidable Satan.

In the 'Padma Purana' it is recorded that when King Vena embraced
heretical doctrine and abjured the temples and sacrifices, the people
following him, seven powerful Rishis, high priests, visited him
and entreated him to return to their faith. They said, 'These acts,
O king, which thou art performing, are not of our holy traditions,
nor fit for our religion, but are such as shall be performed by
mankind at the entrance of Kali, the last and sinful age, when thy
new faith shall be received by all, and the service of the gods be
utterly relinquished.' King Vena, being thus in advance of his time,
was burned on the sacred grass, while a mantra was performed for him.

This theory of Kali is curious as indicating a final triumph of the
enemies of the gods. In the Scandinavian theory of '[[Ragnarok]],' the
Twilight of the gods, there also seems to have been included no hope
of the future victory of the existing gods. In the Parsi faith we
first meet with the belief in a general catastrophe followed by the
supremacy and universal sway of good. This faith characterised the
later Hebrew prophecies, and is the spirit of Paul's brave saying,
'When all things shall be subjected unto him, then also shall the
Son himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that
God may be all in all.'

When, however, theology and metaphysics advanced and modelled this
fiery lava of prophetic and apostolic ages into dogmatic shapes,
evil was accorded an equal duration with good. The conflict between
Christ and his foes was not to end with the conversion or destruction
of his foes, but his final coming as monarch of the world was to
witness the chaining up of the Archfiend in the Pit.

Christ's own idea of Satan, assuming certain reported expressions to
have been really uttered by him, must have been that which regarded
him as a Tempter to evil, whose object was to test the reality of
faith. 'Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked you for himself, that he
might sift you as the wheat; but I made supplication for thee, that
thy faith fail not; and when once thou hast returned, confirm thy
brethren. And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee,
both into prison and into death. And he said, I tell thee, Peter,
a cock will not crow this day till thou wilt thrice deny that thou
knowest me.' [130] Such a sentiment could not convey to Jewish ears
a degraded notion of Satan, except as being a nocturnal spirit who
must cease his work at cock-crow. It is an adaptation of what Jehovah
himself was said to do, in the prophecy of Amos. 'I will not utterly
destroy the house of Jacob, saith the Lord.... I will sift the house
of Israel among all nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve,
yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth.' [131]

Paul, too, appears to have had some such conception of Satan, since he
speaks of an evil-doer as delivered up to Satan 'for the destruction
of the flesh that the spirit may be saved.' [132] There is, however,
in another passage an indication of the distinctness with which Paul
and his friends had conceived a fresh adaptation of Satan as obstacle
of their work. 'For such,' he says, 'are false apostles, deceitful
workers, transforming themselves into apostles of Christ. And no
marvel: for Satan transforms himself into an [[angel]] of light. It is
no great thing therefore if his ministers also transform themselves
as ministers of righteousness; whose end will be according to their
works.' [133] It may be noted here that Paul does not think of Satan
himself as transforming himself to a minister of righteousness, but of
Satan's ministers as doing so. It is one of a number of phrases in the
New Testament which reveal the working of a new movement towards an
expression of its own. Real and far-reaching religious revolutions in
history are distinguished from mere sectarian modifications, which they
sum up in nothing more than in their new phraseology. When Jehovah,
Messias, and Satan are gradually supplanted by Father, Christ, and
Antichrist (or Man of Sin, False Christ, Withholder (katechon), False
Prophet, Son of Perdition, Mystery of Iniquity, Lawless One), it is
plain that new elements are present, and new emergencies. These varied
phrases just quoted could not, indeed, crystallise for a long time into
any single name for the new Obstacle to the new life, for during the
same time the new life itself was too living, too various, to harden
in any definite shape or be marked with any special name. The only New
Testament writer who uses the word Antichrist is the so-called Apostle
John; and it is interesting to remark that it is by him connected
with a dogmatic statement of the nature of Christ and definition of
heresy. 'Every spirit that confesses Jesus Christ is come in the flesh
is of God; and every spirit that confesses not Jesus is not of God:
and this is the spirit of Antichrist, whereof ye have heard that
it comes; and now it is in the world already.' [134] This language,
characteristic of the middle and close of the second century, [135]
is in strong contrast with Paul's utterance in the first century,
describing the Man of Sin (or of lawlessness, the son of perdition),
as one 'who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God,
or that is worshipped; so that he sat in the temple of God, showing
himself that he is God.' [136] Christ has not yet begun to supplant
God; to Paul he is the Son of God confronting the Son of Destruction,
the divine man opposed by the man of sin. When the nature of Christ
becomes the basis of a dogma, the man of sin is at once defined as
the opponent of that dogma.

As this dogma struggled on to its consummation and victory, it
necessarily took the form of a triumph over the Caesars, who were
proclaiming themselves gods, and demanding worship as such. The writer
of the second Epistle bearing Peter's name saw those christians who
yielded to such authority typified in Balaam, the erring prophet who
was opposed by the [[angel]]; [137] the writer of the Gospel of John saw
the traitor Judas as the 'son of perdition,' [138] representing Jesus
as praying that the rest of his disciples might be kept 'out of the
evil one;' and many similar expressions disclose the fact that, towards
the close of the second century, and throughout the third, the chief
obstacle of those who were just beginning to be called 'Christians'
was the temptation offered by Rome to the christians themselves to
betray their sect. It was still a danger to name the very imperial
gods who successively set themselves up to be worshipped at Rome,
but the pointing of the phrases is unmistakable long before the last
of the pagan emperors held the stirrup for the first christian Pontiff
to mount his horse.

Nero had answered to the portrait of 'the son of perdition sitting
in the temple of God' perfectly. He aspired to the title 'King
of the Jews.' He solemnly assumed the name of Jupiter. He had his
temples and his priests, and shared divine honours with his mistress
Poppaea. Yet, when Nero and his glory had perished under those phials
of wrath described in the Apocalypse, a more exact image of the
insidious 'False Christ' appeared in Vespasian. His alleged miracles
('lying wonders'), and the reported prediction of his greatness
by a prophet on Mount Carmel, his oppression of the Jews, who had
to contribute the annual double drachma to support the temples and
gods which Vespasian had restored, altogether made this decorous and
popular emperor a more formidable enemy than the 'Beast' Nero whom
he succeeded. The virtues and philosophy of Marcus Aurelius still
increased the danger. Political conditions favoured all those who
were inclined to compromise, and to mingle the popular pagan and the
Jewish festivals, symbols, and ceremonies. In apocalyptic metaphor,
Vespasian and Aurelius are the two horns of the Lamb who spake like
the Dragon, i.e., Nero (Rev. xiii. 11).

The beginnings of that mongrel of superstitions which at last gained
the name of Christianity were in the liberation, by decay of parts
and particles, of all those systems which Julius Caesar had caged
together for mutual destruction. 'With new thrones rise new altars,'
says Byron's Sardanapalus; but it is still more true that, with new
thrones all altars crumble a little. At an early period the differences
between the believers in Christ and those they called idolaters
were mainly in name; and, with the increase of Gentile converts,
the adoption of the symbolism and practices of the old religions was
so universal that the quarrel was about originality. 'The Devil,'
says Tertullian, 'whose business it is to pervert the truth, mimics
the exact circumstances of the Divine Sacraments in the mysteries of
idols. He himself baptizes some, that is to say, his believers and
followers: he promises forgiveness of sins from the sacred fount,
and thus initiates them into the religion of Mithras; he thus marks
on the forehead his own soldiers: he then celebrates the oblation of
bread; he brings in the symbol of resurrection, and wins the crown
with the sword.' [139]

What masses of fantastic nonsense it was possible to cram into
one brain was shown in the time of Nero, the brain being that of
Simon the Magician. Simon was, after all, a representative man;
he reappears in christian Gnosticism, and Peter, who denounced him,
reappears also in the phrenzy of Montanism. Take the followers of
this Sorcerer worshipping his image in the likeness of Jupiter,
the Moon, and Minerva; and Montanus with his wild women Priscilla
and Maximilla going about claiming to be inspired by the Holy Ghost
to re-establish Syrian orthodoxy and asceticism; and we have fair
specimens of the parties that glared at each other, and apostrophised
each other as children of Belial. They competed with each other by
pretended miracles. They both claimed the name of Christ, and all the
approved symbols and sacraments. The triumph of one party turned the
other into Antichrist.

Thus in process of time, as one hydra-head fell only to be followed
by another, there was defined a Spirit common to and working through
them all--a new devil, whose special office was hostility to Christ,
and whose operations were through those who claimed to be christians
as well as through open enemies.

As usual, when the phrases, born of real struggles, had lost their
meaning, they were handed up to the theologians to be made into
perpetual dogmas. Out of an immeasurable mass of theories and
speculations, we may regard the following passage from Jerome as
showing what had become the prevailing belief at the beginning of
the fifth century. 'Let us say that which all ecclesiastical writers
have handed down, viz., that at the end of the world, when the Roman
Empire is to be destroyed, there will be ten kings, who will divide
the Roman world among them; and there will arise an eleventh little
king who will subdue three of the ten kings, that is, the king of
Egypt, of Africa, and of Ethiopia; and on these having been slain,
the seven other kings will submit.' 'And behold,' he says, 'in the
ram were the eyes of a man'--this is that we may not suppose him to
be a devil or a daemon, as some have thought, but a man in whom Satan
will dwell utterly and bodily--'and a mouth speaking great things;'
for he is the 'man of sin, the son of perdition, who sitteth in the
temple of God making himself as God.' [140]

The 'Little Horn' of Daniel has proved a cornucopia of Antichrists. Not
only the christians but the Jews and the mussulmans have definite
beliefs on the subject. The rabbinical name for Antichrist is Armillus,
a word found in the Targum (Isa. xi. 4): 'By the word of his mouth
the wicked Armillus shall die.' There will be twelve signs of the
Messiah's coming--appearance of three apostate kings, terrible heat of
the sun, dew of blood, healing dew, the sun darkened for thirty days,
universal power of Rome with affliction for Jews, and the appearance
of the first Messias (Joseph's tribe), Nehemiah. The next and seventh
sign will be the appearance of Armillus, born of a marble statue in a
church at Rome. The Romans will accept him as their god, and the whole
world be subject to him. Nehemiah alone will refuse to worship him,
and for this will be slain, and the Jews suffer terrible things. The
eighth sign will be the appearance of the [[angel]] Michael with three
blasts of his trumpet--which shall call forth Elias, the forerunner,
and the true Messias (Ben David), and bring on the war with Armillus
who shall perish, and all christians with him. The ten tribes shall
be gathered into Paradise. Messias shall wed the fairest daughter of
their race, and when he dies his sons shall succeed him, and reign
in unbroken line over a beatified Israel.

The mussulman modification of the notion of Antichrist is very
remarkable. They call him Al Dajjail, that is, the impostor. They say
that Mohammed told his follower Tamisri Al-Dari, that at the end of
the world Antichrist would enter Jerusalem seated on an ass; but that
Jesus will then make his second coming to encounter him. The Beast of
the Apocalypse will aid Antichrist, but Jesus will be joined by Imam
Mahadi, who has never died; together they will subdue Antichrist,
and thereafter the mussulmans and christians will for ever be united
in one religion. The Jews, however, will regard Antichrist as their
expected Messias. Antichrist will be blind of one eye, and deaf of
one ear. 'Unbeliever' will be written on his forehead. In that day
the sun will rise in the west. [141]

The christians poorly requited this amicable theory of the mussulmans
by very extensively identifying Mohammed as Antichrist, at one
period. From that period came the English word mawmet (idol),
and mummery (idolatry), both of which, probably, are derived from
the name of the Arabian Prophet. Daniel's 'Little Horn' betokens,
according to Martin Luther, Mohammed. 'But what are the Little Horn's
Eyes? The Little Horn's Eyes,' says he, 'mean Mohammed's Alkoran,
or Law, wherewith he ruleth. In the which Law there is nought but
sheer human reason (eitel menschliche Vernunft).' ... 'For his Law,'
he reiterates, 'teaches nothing but that which human understanding and
reason may well like.' ... Wherefore 'Christ will come upon him with
fire and brimstone.' When he wrote this--in his 'army sermon' against
the Turks--in 1529, he had never seen a Koran. 'Brother Richard's'
(Predigerordens) Confutatio Alcoran, dated 1300, formed the exclusive
basis of his argument. But in Lent of 1540, he relates, a Latin
translation, though a very unsatisfactory one, fell into his hands,
and once more he returned to Brother Richard, and did his Refutation
into German, supplementing his version with brief but racy notes. This
Brother Richard had, according to his own account, gone in quest of
knowledge to 'Babylon, that beautiful city of the Saracens,' and at
Babylon he had learnt Arabic and been inured in the evil ways of the
Saracens. When he had safely returned to his native land he set about
combating the same. And this is his exordium:--'At the time of the
Emperor Heraclius there arose a man, yea, a Devil, and a first-born
child of Satan, ... who wallowed in ... and he was dealing in the Black
Art, and his name it was Machumet.' ... This work Luther made known to
his countrymen by translating and commenting, prefacing, and rounding
it off by an epilogue. True, his notes amount to little more but an
occasional 'Oh fie, for shame, you horrid Devil, you damned Mahomet,'
or 'O Satan, Satan, you shall pay for that,' or, 'That's it, Devils,
Saracens, Turks, it's all the same,' or, 'Here the Devil smells a rat,'
or briefly, 'O Pfui Dich, Teufel!' except when he modestly, with a
query, suggests whether those Assassins, who, according to his text,
are regularly educated to go out into the world in order to kill and
slay all Worldly Powers, may not, perchance, be the Gypsies or the
'Tattern' (Tartars); or when he breaks down with a 'Hic nescio quid
dicat translator.' His epilogue, however, is devoted to a special
disquisition as to whether Mohammed or the Pope be worse. And in the
twenty-second chapter of this disquisition he has arrived at the
final conclusion that, after all, the Pope is worse, and that he,
and not Mohammed, is the real 'Endechrist.' 'Wohlen,' he winds up,
'God grant us his grace, and punish both the Pope and Mohammed,
together with their devils. I have done my part as a true prophet
and teacher. Those who won't listen may leave it alone.' In similar
strains speaks the learned and gentle Melancthon. In an introductory
epistle to a reprint of that same Latin Koran which displeased Luther
so much, he finds fault with Mohammed, or rather, to use his own
words, he thinks that 'Mohammed is inspired by Satan,' because he
'does not explain what sin is,' and further, since he 'showeth not the
reason of human misery.' He agrees with Luther about the Little Horn:
though in another treatise he is rather inclined to see in Mohammed
both Gog and Magog. And 'Mohammed's sect,' he says, 'is altogether
made up (conflata) of blasphemy, robbery, and shameful lusts.' Nor
does it matter in the least what the Koran is all about. 'Even if
there were anything less scurrilous in the book, it need not concern
us any more than the portents of the Egyptians, who invoked snakes
and cats.... Were it not that partly this Mohammedan pest, and partly
the Pope's idolatry, have long been leading us straight to wreck and
ruin--may God have mercy upon some of us!' [142]

'Mawmet' was used by Wicliffe for idol in his translation of the
New Testament, Acts vii. 41, 'And they made a calf in those days and
offered a sacrifice to the Mawmet' (idol). The word, though otherwise
derived by some, is probably a corruption of Mohammed. In the 'Mappa
Mundi' of the thirteenth century we find the representation of the
golden calf in the promontory of Sinai, with the superscription 'Mahum'
for Mohammed, whose name under various corruptions, such as Mahound,
Mawmet, &c., became a general byword in the mediaeval languages for an
idol. In a missionary hymn of Wesley's Mohammed is apostrophised as--


            That Arab thief, as Satan bold,
            Who quite destroyed Thy Asian fold;


and the Almighty is adjured to--


            The Unitarian fiend expel,
            And chase his doctrine back to Hell.


In these days, when the very mention of the Devil raises a smile,
we can hardly realise the solemnity with which his work was once
viewed. When Goethe represents Mephistopheles as undertaking to
teach Faust's class in theology and dwells on his orthodoxy, it
is the refrain of the faith of many generations. The Devil was not
'God's Ape,' as Tertullian called him, in any comical way; not only
was his ceremonial believed to be modelled on that of God, but his
inspiration of his followers was believed to be quite as potent and
earnest. Tertullian was constrained to write in this strain--'Blush,
my Roman fellow-soldiers, even if ye are not to be judged by Christ,
but by any soldier of Mithras, who when he is undergoing initiation
in the cave, the very camp of the Powers of Darkness, when the wreath
is offered him (a sword being placed between as if in semblance of
martyrdom), and then about to be set on his head, he is warned to
put forth his hand and push the wreath away, transferring it to,
perchance, his shoulder, saying at the same time, My only crown is
Mithras. And thenceforth he never wears a wreath; and this is a mark
he has for a test, whenever tried as to his initiation, for he is
immediately proved to be a soldier of Mithras if he throws down the
wreath offered him, saying his crown is in his god. Let us therefore
acknowledge the craft of the Devil, who mimics certain things of
those that be divine, in order that he may confound and judge us by
the faith of his own followers.'

This was written before the exaltation of Christianity under
Constantine. When the age of the martyrdom of the so-called pagans
came on, these formulae became real, and the christians were still
more confounded by finding that the worshippers of the Devil,
as they thought them, could yield up their lives in many parts of
Europe as bravely for their faith as any christian had ever done. The
'Prince of this world' became thus an unmeaning phrase except for
the heretics. Christ had become the Prince of this world; and he was
opposed by religious devotees as earnest as any who had suffered under
Nero. The relation of the Opposition to the Devil was yet more closely
defined when it claimed the christian name for its schism or heresy,
and when it carried its loyalty to the Adversary of the Church to the
extent of suffering martyrdom. 'Tell me, holy father,' said Evervinus
to St. Bernard, concerning the Albigenses, 'how is this? They entered
to the stake and bore the torment of the fire not only with patience,
but with joy and gladness. I wish your explanation, how these members
of the Devil could persist in their heresy with a courage and constancy
scarcely to be found in the most religious of the faith of Christ?'

Under these circumstances the personification of Antichrist had
a natural but still wonderful development. He was to be born of a
virgin, in Babylon, to be educated at Bethsaida and Chorazin, and to
make a triumphal entry into Jerusalem, proclaiming himself the Son of
God. In the interview at Messina (1202) between Richard I. and the
Abbot Joachim of Floris, the king said, 'I thought that Antichrist
would be born at Antioch or in Babylon, and of the tribe of Dan,
and would reign in the temple of the Lord in Jerusalem, and would
walk in that land in which Christ walked, and would reign in it for
three years and a half, and would dispute against Elijah and Enoch,
and would kill them, and would afterwards die; and that after his
death God would give sixty days of repentance, in which those might
repent which should have erred from the way of truth, and have been
seduced by the preaching of Antichrist and his false prophets.'

This belief was reflected in Western Europe in the belief that the
congregation of Witches assembled on their Sabbath (an institution
then included among paganisms) to celebrate grand mass to the Devil,
and that all the primitive temples were raised in honour of Satan. In
the Russian Church the correspondence between the good and evil powers,
following their primitive faith in the conflict between Byelbog and
Tchernibog (white god and black god), went to the curious extent of
picturing in hell a sort of infernal Trinity. The Father throned in
Heaven with the Son between his knees and the Dove beside or beneath
him, was replied to by a majestic Satan in hell, holding his Son
(Judas) on his knees, and the Serpent acting as counteragent of
the Dove. This singular arrangement may still be seen in many of
the pictures which cover the walls of the oldest Russian churches
(Fig. 9). The infernal god is not without a solemn majesty answering
to that of his great antagonist above. The Serpent of Sins proceeds
from the diabolical Father and Son, passing from beneath their throne
through one of the two mouths of Hell, and then winds upward, hungrily
opening its jaws near the terrible Balances where souls are weighed
(Fig. 10). Along its hideous length are seated at regular intervals
nine winged devils, representing probably antagonists of the nine
Sephiroth or Aeons of the Gnostic theology. Each is armed with a hook
whereby the souls weighed and found wanting may be dragged. The
sins which these devils represent are labelled, generally on
rings around the serpent, and increase in heinousness towards the
head. It is a curious fact that the Sin nearest the head is marked
'Unmercifulness.' Strange and unconscious sarcasm on an Omnipotent
Deity under whose sway exists this elaboration of a scheme of sins
and tortures precisely corresponding to the scheme of virtues and joys!

Truly said the Epistle of John, there be many Antichrists. If this
was true before the word Christianity had been formed, or the system
it names, what was the case afterwards? For centuries we find vast
systems denouncing each other as Antichrist. And ultimately, as a
subtle hardly-conscious heresy spread abroad, the great excommunicator
of antichrists itself, Rome, acquired that title, which it has
never shaken off since. The See of Rome did not first receive that
appellation from Protestants, but from its own chiefs. Gregory himself
(A.C. 590) started the idea by declaring that any man who held even
the shadow of such power as the Popes arrogated to themselves after
his time would be the forerunner of Antichrist. Arnulphus, Bishop
of Orleans, in an invective against John XV. at Rheims (A.C. 991),
intimated that a Pope destitute of charity was Antichrist. But the
stigma was at length fixed (twelfth century) by Amalrich of Bena
('Quia Papa esset Antichristus et Roma Babylon et ipse sedit in
Monte Oliveti, i.e., in pinguedine potestatis'); and also by the
Abbot Joachim (A.C. 1202). The theory of Richard I., as stated to
Joachim concerning Antichrist, has already been quoted. It was in the
presence of the Archbishops of Rouen and Auxerre, and the Bishop of
Bayonne, and represented their opinion and the common belief of the
time. But Joachim said the Second Apocalyptic Beast represented some
great prelate who will be like Simon Magus, and, as it were, universal
Pontiff, and that very Antichrist of whom St. Paul speaks. Hildebrand
was the first Pope to whom this ugly label was affixed, but the
career of Alexander VI. (Roderic Borgia) made it for ever irremovable
for the Protestant mind. There is in the British Museum a volume of
caricatures, dated 1545, in which occurs an ingenious representation
of Alexander VI. The Pope is first seen in his ceremonial robes; but
a leaf being raised, another figure is joined to the lower part of the
former, and there appears the papal devil, the cross in his hand being
changed to a pitchfork (Fig. 11). Attached to it is an explanation in
German giving the legend of the Pope's death. He was poisoned (1503)
by the cup he had prepared for another man. It was afterwards said
that he had secured the papacy by aid of the Devil. Having asked
how long he would reign, the Devil returned an equivocal answer;
and though Alexander understood that it was to be fifteen years, it
proved to be only eleven. When in 1520 Pope Leo X. issued his formal
bull against Luther, the reformer termed it 'the execrable bull of
Antichrist.' An Italian poem of the time having represented Luther
as the offspring of Megaera, the Germans returned the invective in a
form more likely to impress the popular mind; namely, in a caricature
(Fig. 12), representing the said Fury as nursing the Pope. This
caricature is also of date 1545, and with it were others showing
Alecto and Tisiphone acting in other capacities for the papal babe.

The Lutherans had made the discovery that the number of the Apocalyptic
Beast, 666, put into Hebrew numeral letters, contained the words
Aberin Kadescha Papa (our holy father the Pope). The downfall of this
Antichrist was a favourite theme of pulpit eloquence, and also with
artists. A very spirited pamphlet was printed (1521), and illustrated
with designs by Luther's friend Lucas Cranach. It was entitled
Passional Christi und Antichristi. The fall of the papal Antichrist
(Fig. 13), has for its companion one of Christ washing the feet of
his disciples.

But the Catholics could also make discoveries; and among many other
things they found that the word 'Luther' in Hebrew numerals also made
the number of the Beast. It was remembered that one of the earliest
predictions concerning Antichrist was that he would travesty the birth
of Christ from a virgin by being born of a nun by a Bishop. Luther's
marriage with the nun Catharine von Bora came sufficiently near the
prediction to be welcomed by his enemies. The source of his inspiration
as understood by Catholics is cleverly indicated in a caricature of
the period (Fig. 14).

The theory that the Papacy represents Antichrist has so long been the
solemn belief of rebels against its authority, that it has become a
vulgarised article of Protestant faith. On the other hand, Catholics
appear to take a political and prospective view of Antichrist. Cardinal
Manning, in his pastoral following the election of Leo XIII., said:
'A tide of revolution has swept over all countries. Every people
in Europe is inwardly divided against itself, and the old society
of Christendom, with its laws, its sanctities, and its stability,
is giving way before the popular will, which has no law, or rather
which claims to be a law to itself. This is at least the forerunning
sign of the Lawless One, who in his own time shall be revealed.'

Throughout the endless exchange of epithets, it has been made clear
that Antichrist is the reductio ad absurdum of the notion of a personal
Devil. From the day when the word was first coined, it has assumed
every variety of shape, has fitted with equal precision the most
contrarious things and persons; and the need of such a novel form
at one point or another in the progress of controversy is a satire
on the inadequacy of Satan and his ancient ministers. Bygone Devils
cannot represent new animosities. The ascent of every ecclesiastical
or theological system is traceable in massacres and martyrdoms; each
of these, whether on one side or the other, helps to develop a new
devil. The story of Antichrist shows devils in the making. Meantime,
to eyes that see how every system so built up must sacrifice a
virtue at every stage of its ascent, it will be sufficiently clear
that every powerful Church is Adversary of the religion it claims to
represent. Buddhism is Antibuddha; Islam is Antimohammed; Christianity
is Antichrist.

On the parapet of the external gallery of Notre Dame in Paris is the
carved form, of human size, represented in our figure (15). There is
in the face a remarkable expression of pride and satisfaction as he
looks forth on the gay city and contemplates all the wickedness in it,
but this satisfaction is curiously blended with a look of envy and
lust. His elegant head-dress gives him the pomp becoming the Asmodeus
presiding over the most brilliant capital in the world.

His seat on the fine parapet is in contrast with the place assigned
him in Eastern traditions--ruins and desert places,--but otherwise he
fairly fulfilled, no doubt, early ideas in selecting his headquarters
at Paris. A mussulman legend says that when, after the Fall of Man,
Allah was mitigating the sentences he had pronounced, Iblis (who,
as the Koran relates, pleaded and obtained the deferment of his
consignment to Hell until the resurrection, and unlimited power over
sinners who do not accept the word of Allah) asked--

'Where shall I dwell in the meantime?

'In ruins, tombs, and all other unclean places shunned by man.

'What shall be my food?

'All things slain in the name of idols.

'How shall I quench my thirst?

'With wine and intoxicating liquors.

'What shall occupy my leisure hours?

'Music, song, love-poetry, and dancing.

'What is my watchword?

'The curse of Allah until the day of judgment.

'But how shall I contend with man, to whom thou hast granted two
guardian angels, and who has received thy revelation?

'Thy progeny shall be more numerous than his,--for for every man that
is born, there shall come into the world seven evil spirits--but they
shall be powerless against the faithful.'

Iblis with wine, song, and dance--the 'pride of life'--is also said
to have been aided in entering Paradise by the peacock, which he
flattered. [143]

This fable, though later than the era of Mohammed in form, is as
ancient as the myth of Eden in substance. The germ of it is already
in the belief that Jehovah separated from the rest of the earth a
garden, and from the human world a family of his own, and from the
week a day of his own. The reply of the elect to the proud Gentile
aristocracy was an ascetic caste established by covenant with the
King of kings. This attitude of the pious caste turned the barbaric
aristocrats, in a sense, to democrats. Indeed Samael, in whom the
execrated Dukes of Edom were ideally represented, might be almost
described as the Democratic Devil. According to an early Jewish
legend, Jehovah, having resolved to separate 'men' (i.e., Jews)
from 'swine' (i.e., idolaters, Gentiles), made circumcision the
seal on them as children of Abraham. There having been, however,
Jews who were necessarily never circumcised, their souls, it was
arranged, should pass at death into the forms of certain sacred
birds where they would be purified, and finally united to the elect
in Paradise. Now, Samael, or Adam Belial as he was sometimes called,
is said to have appealed to the Creator that this arrangement should
include all races of beings. 'Lord of the world!' he said, 'we also
are of your creation. Thou art our father. As thou savest the souls
of Israel by transforming them that they may be brought back again
and made immortal, so also do unto us! Why shouldst thou regard the
seed of Abraham before us?' Jehovah answered, 'Have you done the same
that Abraham did, who recognised me from his childhood and went into
Chaldean fire for love of me? You have seen that I rescued him from
your hands, and from the fiery oven which had no power over him,
and yet you have not loved and worshipped me. Henceforth speak no
more of good or evil.' [144]

The old rabbinical books which record this conversation do not report
Samael's answer; nor is it necessary: that answer was given by Jesus
and Paul breaking down the partitions between Jew and Gentile. It was
quite another thing, however, to include the world morally. Jesus,
it would seem, aimed at this also; he came 'eating and drinking,'
and the orthodox said Samael was in him. Personally, he declined to
substitute even the cosmopolitan rite of baptism for the discredited
national rite of circumcision. But Paul was of another mind. His
pharisaism was spiritualised and intensified in his new faith, to
which the great world was all an Adversary.

It was a tremendous concession, this giving up of the gay and beautiful
world, with its mirth and amusements, its fine arts and romance--to
the Devil. Unswerving Nemesis has followed that wild theorem in many
forms, of which the most significant is Asmodeus.

Asmodaus, or Aeshma-daeva of the Zend texts, the modern Persian Khasm,
is etymologically what Carlyle might call 'the god Wish;' aesha
meaning 'wish,' from the Sanskrit root ish, 'to desire.' An almost
standing epithet of Aeshma is Khrvidra, meaning apparently 'having a
hurtful weapon or lance.' He is occasionally mentioned immediately
after Anro-mainyus (Ahriman); sometimes is expressly named as one
of his most prominent supporters. In the remarkable combat between
Ahuro-mazda (Ormuzd) and Anro-mainyus, described in Zam. Y. 46, the
good deity summons to his aid Vohumano, Ashavahista, and Fire; while
the Evil One is aided by Akomano, Aeshma, and Aji-Dahaka. [145] Here,
therefore, Aeshma appears as opposed to Ashavahista, 'supreme purity'
of the Lord of Fire. Aeshma is the spirit of the lower or impure Fire,
Lust and Wrath. A Sanskrit text styles him Kossa-deva, 'the god of
Wrath.' In Yacna 27, 35, Sraosha, Aeshma's opponent, is invoked to
shield the faithful 'in both worlds from Death the Violent, from Aeshma
the Violent, from the hosts of Violence that raise aloft the terrible
banner--from the assaults of Aeshma that he makes along with Vidatu
('Divider, Destroyer'), the demon-created.' He is thus the leading
representative of dissolution, the fatal power of Ahriman. Ormuzd
is said to have created Sraosha to be the destroyer of 'Aeshma of
the fatal lance.' Sraosha ('the Hearer') is the moral vanquisher of
Aeshma, in distinction from Haoma, who is his chief opponent in the
physical domain.

Such, following Windischmann, [146] is the origin of the devil
whom the apocryphal book of Tobit has made familiar in Europe as
Asmodeus. Aschmedai, as the Jews called him, appears in this story as
precisely that spirit described in the Avesta--the devil of Violence
and Lust, whose passion for Sara leads him to slay her seven husbands
on their wedding-night. The devils of Lust are considered elsewhere,
and Asmodeus among them; there is another aspect of him which here
concerns us. He is a fastidious devil. He will not have the object of
his passion liable to the embrace of any other. He cannot endure bad
smells, and that raised by the smoke of the fish-entrails burnt by
Tobit drives him 'into the utmost parts of Egypt, where the [[angel]]
bound him.' It is, however, of more importance to read the story
by the light of the general reputation of Aschmedai among the Jews
and Arabians. It was notably that of the devil represented in the
Moslem tradition at the beginning of this chapter. He is the Eastern
Don Giovanni and Lothario; he plies Noah and Solomon with wine,
and seduces their wives, and always aims high with his dashing
intrigues. He would have cried Amen to Luther's lines--


            Who loves not wine, woman, and song,
            He lives a fool his whole life long.


Besides being an aristocrat, he is a scholar, the most learned Master
of Arts, educated in the great College of Hell, founded by Asa and
Asael, as elsewhere related. He was fond of gaming; and so fashionable
that Calmet believed his very name signifies fine dress.

Now, the moral reflections in the Book of Tobit, and its casual
intimations concerning the position of the persons concerned, show
that they were Jewish captives of the humblest working class, whose
religion is of a type now found chiefly among the more ignorant
sectarians. Tobit's moral instructions to his son, 'In pride is
destruction and much trouble, and in lewdness is decay and much want,'
'Drink not wine to make thee drunken,' and his careful instructions
about finding wealth in the fear of God, are precisely such as would
shape a devil in the image of Asmodeus. Tobit's moral truisms are
made falsities by his puritanism: 'Prayer is good with fasting and
alms and righteousness;' 'but give nothing to the wicked;' 'If thou
serve God he will repay thee.'

'Cakes and ale' do not cease to exist because Tobits are virtuous;
but unfortunately they may be raised from their subordinate to an
insubordinate place by the transfer of religious restraints to the
hands of Ignorance and Cant. Asmodeus, defined against Persian and
Jewish asceticism and hypocrisy, had his attractions for men of the
world. Through him the devil became perilously associated with wit,
gallantry, and the one creed of youth which is not at all consumptive--


            Grey is all Theory,
            Green Life's golden-fruited tree!


Especially did Asmodeus represent the subordination of so-called
'religious' and tribal distinctions to secular considerations. As
Samael had petitioned for an extension of the Abrahamic Covenant to
all the world and failed to secure it from Jehovah, Asmodeus proposed
to disregard the distinction. There is much in the Book of Tobit which
looks as if it were written especially with the intention of persuading
Jewish youth, tempted by Babylonians to marriage, that their lovers
might prove to be succubi or incubi. Tobit implores his son to marry
in his own tribe, and not take a 'strange woman.' Asmodeus was as
cosmopolitan as the god of Love himself, and many of his uglier early
characteristics were hidden out of sight by such later developments.

Gustave Dore has painted in his vivid way the 'Triumph of
Christianity.' In it we see the angelic hosts with drawn swords
overthrowing the forms adored of paganism--hurling them headlong
into an abyss. So far as the battle and victory go, this is just
the conception which an early christian would have had of what took
place through the advent of Christ. It filled their souls with joy to
behold by Faith's vision those draped angels casting down undraped
goddesses; they would delight to imagine how the fall might break
the bones of those beautiful limbs. For they never thought of these
gods and goddesses as statues, but as real seductive devils; and when
these christians had brought over the arts, they often pictured the
black souls coming out of these fair idols as they fell.

Dore may have tried to make the angels as beautiful as the goddesses,
but he has not succeeded. In this he has interpreted the heart behind
every deformity which was ever added to a pagan deity. The horror
of the monks was transparent homage. Why did they starve and scourge
their bodies, and roll them in thorns? Because not even by defacing
the beautiful images were they able to expel from their inward worship
the lovely ideals they represented.

It is not difficult now to perceive that the old monks were consigning
the pagan ideals to imaginary and themselves to actual hells, in full
hope of thereby gaining permanent possession of the same beauty abjured
on earth. The loveliness of the world was transient. They grew morbid
about death; beneath the rosiest form they saw the skeleton. The
heavenly angels they longed for were Venuses and Apollos, with no
skeletons visible beneath their immortalised flesh. They never made
sacrifices for a disembodied heaven. The force of self-crucifixion
lay in the creed--'I believe in the resurrection of the body, and
the life everlasting.'

The world could not generally be turned into a black procession at its
own funeral. In proportion to the conquests of Christianity must be its
progressive surrender to the unconquerable--to human nature. Aphrodite
and Eros, over whose deep graves nunneries and monasteries had been
built, were the first to revive, and the story, as Mr. Pater has told
it, is like some romantic version of Ishtar's Descent into Hades and
her resurrection. [147] While as yet the earth seemed frostbound,
long before the Renaissance, the song of the turtle was heard in the
ballad of Aucassin and Nicolette. The christian knight will marry the
beautiful Saracen, and to all priestly warnings that he will surely
go to hell, replies, 'What could I do in Paradise? I care only to go
where I can be with Nicolette. Who go to Paradise? Old priests, holy
cripples, dried-up monks, who pass their lives before altars. I much
prefer Hell, where go the brave, the gay, and beautiful. There will
be the players on harps, the classic poets and singers; and there I
shall not be parted from Nicolette!'

Along with pretty Saracen maidens, or memories of them, were brought
back into Europe legends of Asmodeus. Aphrodite and Eros might disguise
themselves in his less known and less anathematised name, so that
he could manage to sing of his love for Sara, of Parsi for Jewess,
under the names of christian Aucassin and saracen Nicolette. In the
Eastern Church he reappeared also. There are beautiful old pictures
which show the smart cavalier, feather-in-cap, on the youth's left,
while on his right stands 'grey Theory' in the form of a long-bearded
friar. Such pictures, no doubt, taught for many a different lesson
from that intended--namely, that the beat of the heart is on the left.

Where St. Benedict rolled himself in thorns for dreaming of his
(deserted) 'Nicolette,' St. Francis planted roses; and the Latin Church
had to recognise this evolution of seven centuries. They hid the thorns
in the courts of convents, and sold the roses to the outside world as
indulgences. But as Asmodeus had not respected the line between Jew
and Gentile in Nineveh, so he passed over that between priest, nun,
and worldling in the West. In the days of Witchcraft the Church was
scandalised by the rumour that the nuns of the Franciscan Convent of
Louviers had largely taken to sorcery, and were attending the terrible
'Witches' Sabbaths.' The nun most prominent in this affair was one
Madeleine Bavent. The priests announced that she had confessed that
she was borne away to the orgies by the demon Asmodeus, and that
he had induced her to profane the sacred host. It turned out that
the nuns had engaged in intrigues with the priests who had charge
of them--especially with Fathers David, Picard, and Boule--but
Asmodeus was credited with the crime, and the nuns were punished
for it. Madeleine was condemned to life-long penance, and Picard
anticipated the fire by a suicide, in which he was said to have been
assisted by the devil.

Following the rabbinical tradition which represented him as continually
passing from the high infernal College of Asa and Asael to the
earth to apply his arts of sorcery, Asmodeus gained a respectable
position in European literature through the romance of Le Sage ('Le
Diable Boiteux'), and his fame so gained did much to bring about
in France that friendly feeling for the Devil which has long been a
characteristic of French literature. A very large number of books,
periodicals, and journals in France have gained popularity through
the Devil's name. Asmodeus was, in fact, the Arch-bohemian. As such,
he largely influenced the conception of Mephistopheles as rendered by
Goethe--himself the Prince of Bohemians. The old horror of Asmodeus
for bad smells is insulted in the name Mephistopheles, and this devil
is many rolled into one; yet in many respects his kinship to Asmodeus
is revealed. All the dried starveling Anthonys and Benedicts are,
in a cultured way, present in the theologian and scholar Faust;
all the sweet ladies that haunted their seclusion became realistic
in Gretchen. She is the Nemesis of suppressed passions.

One province of nature after another has been recovered from
Asceticism. In this case Ishtar has had to regain her apparel and
ornaments at successive portals that are centuries, and they are not
all recovered yet. But we have gone far enough, even in puritanised
England, to produce a 'madman' far-seeing enough to behold The
Marriage of Heaven and Hell. The case of Asmodeus is stated well,
albeit radically, by William Blake, in that proverb which was told
him by the devils, whom he alone of midnight travellers was shrewd
enough to consult: 'The pride of the peacock is the glory of God;
the lust of the goat is the bounty of God; the wrath of the lion is
the wisdom of God.' When that statement is improved, as it well may
be, it will be when those who represent religion shall have learned
that human like other nature is commanded by obedience.

In this connection may be mentioned a class of legends indicating
the Devil's sensitiveness with regard to his personal appearance. The
anxiety of the priests and hermits to have him represented as hideous
was said to have been warmly resented by Satan, one of the most
striking being the legend of many versions concerning a Sacristan,
who was also an artist, who ornamented an abbey with a devil so ugly
that none could behold it without terror. It was believed he had by
inspiration secured an exact portrait of the archfiend. The Devil
appeared to the Sacristan, reproached him with having made him so
ugly, and threatened to punish him grievously if he did not make him
better looking. Although this menace was thrice repeated, the Sacristan
refused to comply. The Devil then tempted him into an intrigue with a
lady of the neighbourhood, and they eloped after robbing the abbey of
its treasure. But they were caught, and the Sacristan imprisoned. The
Devil then appears and offers to get him out of his trouble if he will
only destroy the ugly likeness, and make another and handsomer. The
Sacristan consented, and suddenly found himself in bed as if nothing
had happened, while the Devil in his image lay in chains. The Devil
when discovered vanished; the Sacristan got off on the theory that
crimes and all had been satanic juggles. But the Sacristan took care
to substitute a handsome devil for the ugly one. In another version
the Sacristan remained faithful to his original portraiture of the
Devil despite all menaces of the latter, who resolved to take a dire
revenge. While the artist was completing his ornamentation of the abbey
with an image of the Virgin, made as beautiful as the fiend near it was
ugly, the Devil broke the ladder on which he was working, and a fatal
fall was only prevented by the hand of the Madonna he had just made,
which was outstretched to sustain him. The accompanying picture of this
scene (Fig. 16) is from 'Queen Mary's Psalter' in the British Museum.

Vasari relates that when Spinello of Arezzo, in his famous fresco of
the fall of the rebellious angels, had painted the hideous devil with
seven faces about his body, the fiend appeared to him in the same form,
and asked the artist where he had seen him in so frightful an aspect,
and why he had treated him so ignominiously. When Spinello awoke in
horror, he fell into a state of gloom, and soon after died.

The Persian poet Sadi has a remarkable passage conceived in the spirit
of these legends, but more kindly.


            I saw the demon in a dream,
              But how unlike he seemed to be
            To all of horrible we dream,
              And all of fearful that we see.
            His shape was like a cypress bough,
              His eyes like those that Houris wear,
            His face as beautiful as though
              The rays of Paradise were there.
            I near him came, and spoke--'Art thou,'
              I said, 'indeed the Evil One?
            No [[angel]] has so bright a brow,
              Such yet no eye has looked upon.
            Why should mankind make thee a jest,
              When thou canst show a face like this?
            Fair as the moon in splendour drest,
              An eye of joy, a smile of bliss!
            The painter draws thee vile to sight,
              Our baths thy frightful form display;
            They told me thou wert black as night,
              Behold, thou art as fair as day!'
            The lovely vision's ire awoke,
              His voice was loud and proud his mien:
            'Believe not, friend!' 'twas thus he spoke,
              'That thou my likeness yet hast seen:
            The pencil that my portrait made
              Was guided by an envious foe;
            In Paradise I man betrayed,
              And he, from hatred, paints me so.'


Boehme relates that when Satan was asked the cause of God's enmity
to him and his consequent downfall, he replied, 'I wished to be an
artist.' There is in this quaint sentence a very true intimation of the
allurements which, in ancient times, the arts of the Gentile possessed
for the Jews and christian judaisers. Indeed, a similar feeling towards
the sensuous attractions of the Catholic and Ritualistic Churches is
not uncommon among the prosaic and puritanical sects whose younger
members are often thus charmed away from them. Dr. Donne preached a
sermon before Oliver Cromwell at Whitehall, in which he affirmed that
the Muses were damned spirits of devils; and the discussion on the
Drama which occurred at Sheffield Church Congress (1878), following
Dr. Bickerstith's opening discourse on 'the Devil and his wiles,'
shows that the Low Church wing cherishes much the same opinion as that
of Dr. Donne. The dread of the theatre among some sects amounts to
terror. The writer remembers the horror that spread through a large
Wesleyan circle, with which he was connected, when a distinguished
minister of that body, just returned from Europe, casually remarked
that 'the theatre at Rome seemed to be poorly supported.' The fearful
confession spread through the denomination, and it was understood that
the observant traveller had 'made shipwreck of faith.' The Methodist
instinct told true: the preacher became an accomplished Gentile.

Music made its way but slowly in the Church, and the suspicion of it
still lingers among many sects. The Quakers took up the burthen of
Epiphanius who wrote against the flute-players, 'After the pattern
of the serpent's form has the flute been invented for the deceiving
of mankind. Observe the figure that the player makes in blowing his
flute. Does he not bend himself up and down to the right hand and
to the left, like unto the serpent? These forms hath the Devil used
to manifest his blasphemy against things heavenly, to destroy things
upon earth, to encompass the world, capturing right and left such as
lend an ear to his seductions.' The unregenerate birds that carol
all day, be it Sabbath or Fast, have taught the composer that his
best inspiration is from the Prince of the Air. Tartini wrote over a
hundred sonatas and as many concertos, but he rightly valued above
them all his 'Sonata del Diavolo.' Concerning this he wrote to the
astronomer Lalande:--'One night, in the year 1713, I dreamed that I
had made a compact with his Satanic Majesty, by which he was received
into my service. Everything succeeded to the utmost of my desires, and
my every wish was anticipated by my new domestic. I thought that, in
taking up my violin to practise, I jocosely asked him if he could play
on this instrument. He answered that he believed he was able to pick
out a tune; when, to my astonishment, he began a sonata, so strange,
and yet so beautiful, and executed in so masterly a manner, that in the
whole course of my life I had never heard anything so exquisite. So
great was my amazement that I could scarcely breathe. Awakened
by the violence of my feelings, I instantly seized my violin, in
the hope of being able to catch some part of the ravishing melody
which I had just heard, but all in vain. The piece which I composed
according to my scattered recollections is, it is true, the best I
ever produced. I have entitled it, 'Sonata del Diavolo;' but it is so
far inferior to that which had made so forcible an impression on me,
that I should have dashed my violin into a thousand pieces, and given
up music for ever in despair, had it been possible to deprive myself
of the enjoyments which I receive from it.'

The fire and originality of Tartini's great work is a fine
example of that power which Timoleon called Automatia, and Goethe
the Damonische,--'that which cannot be explained by reason or
understanding; it is not in my nature, but I am subject to it.' 'It
seems to play at will with all the elements of our being.'

The Puritans brought upon England and America that relapse into the
ancient asceticism which was shown in the burning of great pictures
by Cromwell's Parliament. It is shown still in the jealousy with
which the puritanised mind in both countries views all that aims at
the simple decoration of life, and whose ministry is to the sense of
beauty. On that day of the week when England and New England hebraise,
as Matthew Arnold says, it is observable that the sabbatarian fury is
especially directed against everything which proposes to give simple
pleasure or satisfy the popular craving for beauty. Sabbatarianism
sees a great deal of hard work going on, but is not much troubled so
long as it is ugly and dismal work. It utters no cry at the thousands
of hands employed on Sunday railways, but is beside itself if one of
the trains takes excursionists to the seaside, and is frantic at the
thought of a comparatively few persons being employed on that day in
Museums and Art Galleries. It is a survival of the old feeling that
the Devil lurks about all beauty and pleasure.

A money-making age has measurably dispersed the superstitions which
once connected the Devil with all great fortunes. For a long time,
and in many regions of the world, the Jews suffered grievously by
being supposed to get their wealth by the Devil's help. Their wealth
(largely the result of their not exchanging it for worldly enjoyments)
so often proved their misfortune, that it was easy to illustrate by
their case the monkish theory that devil's gifts turn to ashes. Princes
were indefatigable in relieving the Jews of such ashes, however. The
Lords of Triar, who possessed the mines of Glucksbrunn, were believed
to have been guided to them by a gold stag which often appeared to
them--of course the Devil. It is related that when St. Wolfram went
to convert the Frislanders, their king, Radbot, was prevented from
submitting to baptism by a diabolical deception. The Devil appeared
to him as an [[angel]] clothed in a garment woven of gold, on his head
a jewelled diadem, and said, 'Bravest of men! what has led thee to
depart from the Prince of thy gods? Do it not; be steadfast to thy
religion and thou shalt dwell in a house of gold which I will give
into thy possession to all eternity. Go to Wolfram to-morrow, ask
him about those bright dwellings he promises thee. If he cannot show
them, let both parties choose an ambassador; I will be their leader
and will show them the gold house I promise thee.' St. Wolfram being
unable to show Radbot the bright dwellings of Paradise, one of his
deacons was sent along with a representative of the king, and the
Devil (disguised as a traveller) took them to the house of gold,
which was of incredible size and splendour. The Deacon exclaimed,
'If this house be made by God it will stand for ever; if by the
Devil, it must vanish speedily.' Whereupon he crossed himself; the
house vanished, and the Deacon found himself with the Frislander in
a swamp. It took them three days to extricate themselves and return
to King Radbot, whom they found dead.

The ascetic principle which branded the arts, interests, pursuits,
and pleasures of the world as belonging to the domain of Satan,
involved the fatal extreme of including among the outlawed realms all
secular learning. The scholar and man of science were also declared
to be inspired by the 'pride of life.' But this part of our subject
requires a separate chapter.







CHAPTER XXIII.

THE CURSE ON KNOWLEDGE.

A Bishop on intellect--The Bible on learning--The Serpent and
Seth--A Hebrew Renaissance--Spells--Shelley at Oxford--
Book-burning--Japanese ink-devil--Book of Cyprianus--Devil's
Bible--Red letters--Dread of Science--Roger Bacon--Luther's
Devil--Lutherans and Science.


In Lucas van Leyden's picture of Satan tempting Christ (Fig. 6),
the fiend is represented in the garb of a University man of the
time. From his head falls a streamer which coils on the ground to a
serpent. From that serpent to the sceptical scholar demanding a miracle
the evolution is fully traceable. The Serpent, of old the 'seer,'
was in its Semitic adaptation a tempter to forbidden knowledge. This
was the earliest priestly outcry against 'godless education.'

During the Shakespere tercentenary festival at Stratford-on-Avon,
the Bishop of St. Andrews declared that there is not a word in the
Bible warranting homage to Intellect, and such a boast beside the
grave of the most intellectual of Englishmen is in itself a survival
illustrating the tremendous curse hurled by jealous Jehovah on man's
first effort to obtain knowledge. That same Serpent of knowledge
has passed very far, and his curse has many times been repeated. In
the Accadian poem of the fatal Seven, as we have seen, it is said,
'In watching was their office;' and the Assyrian version says,
'Unto heaven that which was not seen they raised.' On the Babylonian
cylinders is inscribed the curse of the god of Intelligence (Hea)
upon man--'Wisdom and knowledge hostilely may they injure him.' [148]
The same Serpent twined round the staff of Aesculapius and whispered
those secrets which made the gods jealous, so that Jove killed the
learned Physician with a flash of lightning. Its teeth were sown when
Cadmus imported the alphabet into Greece; and when these alphabetical
dragon's-teeth had turned to type, the ancient curse was renewed in
legends which connected Fust with the Devil.

The Hebrews are least among races responsible for the legend which
has drifted into Genesis. Nor was the Bishop's boast about their Bible
correct. The homage paid to Solomon was hardly on account of his moral
character. 'He spake of trees, from the cedar-tree that is in Lebanon,
even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall; he spake also of
beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes.' [149]
While the curse on man for eating the fruit of knowledge is never
quoted in the Hebrew scriptures, there are many indications of their
devotion to knowledge; and their prophets even heard Jehovah saying,
'My people are destroyed through lack of knowledge.' It is not
wonderful, therefore, that we find among the Jews the gradual growth
of a legend concerning Seth, which may be regarded as a reply to the
curse on the Serpent.

The apotheosis of Seth in rabbinical and mussulman mythology represents
a sort of Semitic Renaissance. As we have seen in a former chapter,
the Egyptians and Greeks identified Set with Typhon, but at the same
time that demon was associated with science. He is astronomically
located in Capricorn, the sphere of the hierophants in the Egyptian
Mysteries, and the mansion of the guardians of science. Thus he would
correspond with the Serpent, who, as adapted by the Hebrews in the
myth of Eden, whispers to Eve of divine knowledge. But, as detached
from Typho, Seth, while leaving behind the malignancy, carried away
the reputation for learning usually ascribed to devils. Thus, while we
have had to record so many instances of degraded deities, we may note
in Seth a converted devil. In the mussulman and rabbinical traditions
Seth is a voluminous author; he receives a library from heaven; he is
the originator of astronomy and of many arts; and, as an instructor in
cultivation, he restores many an acre which as Set he had blighted. In
the apocryphal Genesis he is represented as having been caught up to
heaven and shown the future destiny of mankind. Anastasius of Sinai
says that when God created Adam after his own image, he breathed
into him grace and illumination, and a ray of the Holy Spirit. But
when he had sinned this glory left him. Then he became the father of
Cain and Abel. But afterwards it is said Adam 'begat a son in his own
likeness, after his image, and called his name 'Seth,' which is not
said of Cain and Abel; and this means that Seth was begotten in the
likeness of unfallen man in paradise--Seth meaning 'Resurrection.' And
all those then living, when they saw how the face of Seth shone with
divine light, and heard him speak with divine wisdom, said, He is God;
therefore his sons were commonly called the sons of God. [150]

That this 'Resurrection' of departed glory and wisdom was really,
as I have said, a Renaissance--a restoration of learning from the
curse put upon it in the story of the Serpent--is indicated by
its evolution in the Gnostic myth wherein Seth was made to avenge
Satan. He took under his special care the Tree of the Knowledge of
Good and Evil, and planted it in his father's grave (Fig. 8). Rabbins
carried their homage to Seth even to the extent of vindicating Saturn,
the most notorious of planets, and say that Abraham and the Prophets
were inspired by it. [151] The Dog (Jackal) was, in Egyptian symbols,
emblem of the Scribe; Sirius was the Dog-star domiciled with Saturn;
Seth was by them identified with Sirius, as the god of occult
and infernal knowledge. He was near relative of the serpent Sesha,
familiar of Aesculapius, and so easily connected with the subtlest of
the beasts in Eden which had crept in from the Iranian mythology.

This reaction was instituted by scholars, who, in their necessarily
timid way of fable, may be said to have recovered the Tree of
Knowledge under guise of homage to Seth. It flourished, as we have seen
(chap. xi.), to the extent of finally raising the Serpent to be a god,
and lowering Jehovah who cursed him to a jealous devil!

But the terror with which Jehovah is said to have been inspired when
he said, 'The man has become as one of us, to know good and evil,'
never failed to reappear among priesthoods when anything threatened
to remove the means of learning from under their control. The causes
of this are too many to be fully considered here; but the main cause
unquestionably was the tendency of learning to release men from
the sway of the priest. The primitive man of science would speedily
discover how many things existed of which his priest was ignorant, and
thus the germ of Scepticism would be planted. The man who possessed
the Sacred Books, in whole or in part, might become master of the
'spells' supposed to be contained in its words and sentences, and
might use them against the priests; or, at any rate, he might feel
independent of the ordinary apparatus of salvation.

The anxiety of priests to keep fast hold of the keys of learning,
so that no secular son of Adam should become 'as one of them,'
coupled with the wonderful powers they professed ability to exercise,
powerfully stimulated the curiosity of intellectual men, and led
them to seek after this forbidden fruit in subtle ways, which
easily illustrated the story of the Serpent. The poet Shelley,
who was suspected at Oxford because of his fondness for chemistry,
recognised his mythological ancestry, and used to speak of 'my
cousin, the Serpent.' The joke was born of circumstances sufficiently
scandalous in the last generation to make the Oxonian of to-day blush;
but the like histories of earlier ages are so tragical that, when fully
known by the common people, they will change certain familiar badges
into brands of shame. While the cant goes on about the Church being
the protector of learning through the dark ages, the fact is that,
from the burning of valuable books at Ephesus by christian fanatics
(Acts xix. 19) to the present day, the Church has destroyed tenfold
more important works than it ever produced, and almost suffocated the
intellectual life of a thousand years. Amid the unbroken persecution
of the Jews by christian cruelty, which lasted from the early eleventh
century for five hundred years, untold numbers of manuscripts were
destroyed, which might have now been giving the world full and clear
knowledge concerning ages, for whose records archaeological scholars
are painfully exploring the crumbled ruins of the East. Synagogues
were believed to be temples of Satan; they were plundered and razed
to the ground, and their precious archives strewed the streets of
many cities. On the 17th of June 1244 twenty-four cartloads of these
ancient MSS. were burned in Paris alone. "And all this by our holy
'protector of learning' through the Middle Ages!

The Japanese have pictures of a famous magician who conjured up a
demon--vast, vague, and terrible--out of his inkstand. They call
it latterly 'emblem of a licentious press,' but, no doubt, it was
originally used to terrify the country generally concerning the
press. That Devil has also haunted the ecclesiastical imagination
in Europe. Nearly every book written without priestly command was
associated with the Devil, and there are several old books in Europe,
laboriously and honestly written, which to this day are invested with
popular superstitions reporting the denunciations with which they
were visited. For some centuries it has been believed in Denmark and
neighbouring countries that a strange and formidable book exists,
by means of which you can raise or lay the Devil. It is vulgarly
known as the Book of Cyprianus. The owner of it can neither sell,
bury, or burn it, and if he cannot get rid of it before his death,
he becomes the prey of the fiend. The only way of getting rid of it is
to find somebody who will accept it as a present, well knowing what it
is. Cyprianus is said to have been a clever and virtuous young student,
but he studied the black art in Norway, and came under the power of the
Devil, who compelled him to use his unholy learning to evil ends. This
grieved him sorely, and he wrote a book, in which he shows first,
how evil shall be done, and then how to counteract it. The book is
probably one which really exists or existed, and professed to teach
the art of sorcery, and likewise the charms against it. It consists
of three parts, severally called Cyprianus, Dr. Faust, and Jacob
Ramel. The two latter are written in cypher. It teaches everything
appertaining to 'signing,' conjuring, second sight, and all the
charms alluded to in Deuteronomy xviii. 10-12. The person possessing
Cyprianus' book is said never to be in need of money, and none can
harm him. The only way of getting rid of it is to put it away in a
secret place in a church along with a clerk's fee of four shillings.

In Stockholm I saw the so-called Devil's Bible, the biggest book in
the world, in the Royal Library. It is literally as they describe it,
'gigas librorum': no single man can lift it from the floor. It was part
of the booty carried off by the Swedes after the surrender of Prague,
A.D. 1648. It contains three hundred parchment leaves, each one made of
an ass's hide, the cover being of oak planks, 1 1/2 inches thick. It
contains the Old and New Testaments; Josephi Flavii Antiquitates
Judaicae; Isidori Episcopi L. XX. de diversis materiis; Confessio
peccatorum; and some other works. The last-named production is written
on black and dark brown ground with red and yellow letters. Here and
there sentences are marked 'haec sunt suspecta,' 'superstitiosa,'
'prohibita.' One MS., which is headed, 'Experimentum de furto et
febribus', is a treatise in Monkish Latin on the exorcism of ghosts
and evil spirits, charms against thieves and sickness, and various
prescriptions in 'White Magic.' The age of the book is considerably
over three hundred years. The autograph of a German emperor is in it:
'Ferdinandus Imperator Romanorum, A.D. 1577.' The volume is known
in Sweden as Fan's Bibel (Devil's Bible). The legend says, that
a monk, suspected of black arts, who had been condemned to death,
begged for life, and his judge mockingly told him that he would be
pardoned only if he should produce next morning all the books here
found and in this vast size. The monk invoked the Devil's assistance,
and the ponderous volume was written in a single night. This Devil
must have been one who prided himself more on his literary powers
than his personal appearance; for the face and form said to be his
portrait, frontispiece of the volume, represent a most hideous ape,
green and hairy, with horrible curled tusks. It is, no doubt, the ape
Anerhahn of the Wagner legends; Burns's 'towzie tyke, black, grim,
and large.' [152]

I noticed particularly in this old work the recurrence of deep red
letters and sentences similar to the ink which Fust used at the close
of his earliest printed volumes to give his name, with the place and
date of printing. Now Red is sacred in one direction as symbolising
the blood of Christ, but it is also the colour of Judas, who betrayed
that blood. Hence, while red letters might denote sacred days and
sentences in priestly calendars, they might be supposed mimicry
of such sanctities by 'God's Ape' if occurring in secular works or
books of magic. It is said that these red letters were especially
noted in Paris as indications of the diabolical origin of the works
so easily produced by Fust; and, though it is uncertain whether he
suffered imprisonment, the red lines with his name appear to have
been regarded as his signature in blood.

For a long time every successive discovery of science, every invention
of material benefit to man, was believed by priest-ridden peoples
to have been secured by compact with the devil. The fate of the
artist Prometheus, fettered by jealous Jove, was repeated in each
who aspired to bring light to man, and some men of genius--such as
Cornelius Agrippa, and Paracelsus--appear to have been frightened away
from legitimate scientific research by the first connection of their
names with sorcery. They had before them the example of the greatest
scientific man of the Middle Ages, Roger Bacon, and knew how easily,
in the priestly whisper, the chemist's crucible grew to a wizard's
cauldron. The time may come when Oxford University will have learned
enough to build a true memorial of the grandest man who ever wrote
and taught within its walls. It would show Roger Bacon--rectifier
of the Julian Calendar, analyst of lenses, inventor of spectacles
and achromatic lenses, probable constructor of the first telescope,
demonstrator of the chemical action of air in combustion, inventor of
the mode of purifying saltpetre and crystallising it into gunpowder,
anticipator of the philosophical method with which his namesake is
credited--looking on a pile of his books for whose researches he had
paid two thousand French livres, to say nothing of a life's labour,
only to see them condemned by his University, their circulation
prohibited; and his sad gaze might be from the prison to which the
Council of Franciscans at Paris sentenced him whom Oxford gladly
delivered into their hands. He was condemned, says their historian
Wadding, 'propter novitates quasdam suspectas.' The suspected novelties
were crucibles, retorts, and lenses that made the stars look larger. So
was it with the Oxford six hundred years ago. Undeniably some progress
had been made even in the last generation, for Shelley was only
forbidden to study chemistry, and expelled for his metaphysics. But
now that it is claimed that Oxford is no longer partaker with them
that stoned investigators and thinkers from Bacon to Shelley, it would
be in order to build for its own great martyr of science a memorial,
that superstition may look on one whom it has pierced.

Referring to Luther's inkstand thrown at the Devil, Dr. Zerffii,
in his lecture on the Devil, says, 'He (the devil) hates nothing
so much as writing or printer's ink.' But the truth of this remark
depends upon which of two devils be considered. It would hardly
apply to the Serpent who recommended the fruit of knowledge, or to
the University man in Lucas van Leyden's picture (Fig. 6). But if
we suppose the Devil of Luther's Bible (Fig. 17) to be the one at
which the inkstand was thrown, the criticism is correct. The two
pictures mentioned may be instructively compared. Luther's Devil
is the reply of the University to the Church. These are the two
devils--the priest and the scholar--who glared at each other in the
early sixteenth century. 'The Devil smelled the roast,' says Luther,
'that if the languages revived, his kingdom would get a hole which
he could not easily stop again.' And it must be admitted that some
of the monkish execrations of the time, indeed of many times since,
have an undertone of Jahvistic jealousy. 'These Knowers will become
as one of us.' It must also be admitted that the clerical instinct
told true: the University man held in him that sceptical devil who
is always the destroyer of the priest's paradise. These two devils
which struggled with each other through the sixteenth century still
wage their war in the arena of Protestantism. Many a Lutheran now
living may remember to have smiled when Hofmann's experiments in
discovering carbonic acid gas gained him repute for raising again
Mephosto; but perhaps they did not recognise Luther's devil when,
at the annual assembly of Lutheran Pastors in Berlin (Sept. 1877), he
reappeared as the Rev. Professor Grau, and said, 'Not a few listen to
those striving to combine Christ with Belial, to reconcile redeeming
truth with modern science and culture.' But though they who take the
name of Luther in vain may thus join hands with the Devil, at whom
the Reformer threw his inkstand, the combat will still go on, and the
University Belial do the brave work of Bel till beneath his feet lies
the dragon of Darkness whether disguised as Pope or Protestant.

If the Church wishes to know precisely how far the roughness pardonable
in the past survives unpardonably in itself, let its clergy peruse
carefully the following translation by Mr. Leland of a poem by Heine;
and realise that the Devil portrayed in it is, by grace of its own
prelates, at present the most admired personage in every Court and
fashionable drawing-room in Christendom.


            I called the Devil, and he came:
            In blank amaze his form I scan.
            He is not ugly, is not lame,
            But a refined, accomplished man,--
            One in the very prime of life,
            At home in every cabinet strife,
            Who, as diplomatist, can tell
            Church and State news extremely well.
            He is somewhat pale--and no wonder either,
            Since he studies Sanskrit and Hegel together.
            His favourite poet is still Fonque.
            Of criticism he makes no mention,
            Since all such matters unworthy attention
            He leaves to his grandmother, Hecate.
            He praised my legal efforts, and said
            That he also when younger some law had read,
            Remarking that friendship like mine would be
            An acquisition, and bowed to me,--
            Then asked if we had not met before,
            At the Spanish Minister's soiree?
            And, as I scanned his face once more,
            I found I had known him for many a day.

St. Cyprian saw the devil in a flower. [153] That little vision may
report more than many more famous ones the consistency with which
the first christians had developed the doctrine that nature is the
incarnation of the Evil Spirit. It reports to us the sense of many
sounds and sights which were heard and seen by ears and eyes trained
for such and no other, all showing that the genii of nature and
beauty were vanishing from the earth. Over the Aegean sea were heard
lamentations and the voice, 'Great Pan is dead!' Augustus consults
the oracle of Apollo and receives reply--


        Me puer Hebraeus, Divos Deus ipse gubernans,
        Cedere sede jubet, tristremque redire sub orcum;
        Aris ergo dehinc tacitis abscedito nostris.


But while the rage of these Fathers towards all the great gods and
goddesses, who in their grand temples represented 'the pride of life,'
was remorseless, they were comparatively indifferent to the belief or
disbelief of the lower classes in their small tutelary divinities. They
appear almost to have encouraged belief in these, perhaps appreciating
the advantages of the popular custom of giving generous offerings
to such personal and domestic patrons. At a very early period there
seems to have arisen an idea of converting these more plebeian spirits
into guardian angels with christian names. Thus Jerome relates in
his Life of the first Hermit Paul, that when St. Anthony was on his
way to visit that holy man, he encountered a Centaur who pointed
out the way; and next a human-like dwarf with horns, hooked fingers,
and feet like those of a goat. St. Anthony believing this to be an
apparition of the Devil, made the sign of the Cross; but the little
man, nowise troubled by this, respectfully approached the monk,
and having been asked who he was, answered: 'I am a mortal, and one
of those inhabitants of the Desert whom the Gentiles in their error
worship under the names of Fauns, Satyrs, and Incubi: I am delegated
by my people to ask of thee to pray for us to our common God, who we
know has descended for the salvation of the world, and whose praises
resound in all the earth.' At this glorification of Christ St. Anthony
was transported with joy, and turning towards Alexandria he cried,
'Woe to thee, adulterous city, which adorest animals as gods!'

Perhaps the evolution of these desert demons into good christians would
have gone on more rapidly and completely if the primitive theologians
had known as much of their history as comparative mythology has
disclosed to the modern world. St. Anthony was, however, fairly on
the track of them when he turned towards Alexandria. Egypt appears
to have been the especial centre from which were distributed through
the world the fetish guardians of provinces, towns, households and
individuals. Their Serapes reappear in the Teraphim of Laban, and many
of the forms they used reappear in the Penates, Lares, and genii of
Latin countries. All these in their several countries were originally
related to its ancient religion or mythology, but before the christian
era they were very much the same in Egypt, Greece, and Italy. They were
shaped in many different, but usually natural forms, such as serpents,
dogs, boys, and old men, though often some intimation was given of
their demonic character. They were so multiplied that even plants
and animals had their guardians. The anthropomorphic genii called the
Patrii, who were supposed to preside over provinces, were generally
represented bearing weapons with which they defended the regions of
which they were patrons. These were the Averrunci or Apotropaei.

There are many interesting branches of this subject which cannot be
entered into here, and others have already been considered in the
foregoing parts of this work. It is sufficient for my present purpose
to remark, that, in the course of time, all the households of the world
had traditional guardians; these were generally represented in some
shape on amulets and talismans, on which were commonly inscribed the
verbal charms by which the patron could be summoned. In the process
of further time the amulets--especially such as were reproduced
by tribes migrating from the vicinity of good engravers--might
be marked only with the verbal charms; these again were, in the
end, frequently represented only by some word or name. This was the
'spell.' Imagination fails in the effort to conceive how many strata of
extinct deities had bequeathed to the ancient Egyptians those mystical
names whose exact utterance they believed would constrain each god so
named to appear and bind him to serve the invoker's purpose whether
good or evil. [154] This idea continued among the Jews and shaped
the commandment, 'Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God
in vain.'

It was in these diminutive forms that great systems survived among
the common people. Amid natural convulsions ancient formations of
faith were broken into fragments; in the ebb and flow of time these
fragments were smoothed, as it were, into these talismanic pebbles. Yet
each of these conveyed all the virtue which had been derived from the
great and costly ceremonial system from which it originally crumbled;
the virtue of soothing the mind and calming the nerves of sufferers
with the feeling that, though they might have been assailed by
hostile powers, they had friendly powers too who were active in their
behalf--Vindicators, to recall Job's phrase--who at last would stand
by them to the end. In the further ebb and flow of generations the
mass of such charms are further pulverised into sand or into mud; but
not all of them: amid the mud will be found many surviving specimens,
and such mud of accumulated superstitions is always susceptible of
being remoulded after such lingering models, should occasion demand.

Erasmus, in his 'Adages,' suggests that it was from these genii of
'the Gentiles' that the christians derived their notion of each person
being attended by two angels, a good and a bad. Probably he was but
half right. The peoples to whom he refers did not generally believe
that each man was attended by a bad spirit, a personal enemy. That was
an honour reserved for individuals particularly formidable to the evil
powers,--Adam, Jacob, Hercules, or Zoroaster. The one preternatural
power attending each ordinary individual defended him from the general
forces of evil. But it was Christianity which, in the gradual effort
to substitute patron-saints and guardian-angels of its own for the
pagan genii, turned the latter from friends to enemies, and their
protecting into assailing weapons.

All the hereditary household gods of what is now called Christendom
were diabolised. But in order that the masses might turn from them
and invoke christian guardians, the Penates, Lares, and genii had to
be belittled on the one hand, and the superior power of the saints
and angels demonstrated. When Christianity had gained the throne of
political power, it was easy to show that the 'imps,' as the old
guardians were now called, could no longer protect their invokers
from christian punishment, or confer equal favours.

Christianity conquered Europe by the sword, but at first that sword
was not wielded against the humble masses. It was wielded against
their proud oppressors. To the common people it brought glad tidings
of a new order, in which, under the banner of a crucified working-man
and his (alleged) peasant mother, all caste should disappear but that
of piety and charity. Christ eating with publicans and sinners and
healing the wayside cripples reappeared in St. Martin dividing his
embroidered cloak with a beggar--type of a new aristocracy. They
who worshipped the Crucified Peasant in the rock-cave of Tours
which St. Martin had consecrated, or in little St. Martin's Church
at Canterbury where Bertha was baptized, could not see the splendid
cathedrals now visible from them, built of their bones and cemented
with their blood. King Ethelbert surrendered the temple of his idol
to the consecration of Augustine, and his baptized subjects had no
difficulty in seeing the point of the ejected devil's talons on the
wall which he assailed when the first mass was therein celebrated.

Glad tidings to the poor were these that the persecuted first
missionaries brought to Gaul, Britain, and Germany. But they did not
last. The christians and the pagan princes, like Herod and Pilate,
joined hands to crucify the European peasant, and he was reduced to
a worse serfdom than he had suffered before. Every humble home in
Europe was trampled in the mire in the name of Christ. The poor man's
wife and child, and all he possessed were victims of the workman of
Jerusalem turned destroyer of his brethren. Michelet has well traced
Witchcraft to the Despair of the Middle Ages. [155] The decay of
the old religions, which Christianity had made too rapid for it to
be complete, had left, as we have seen, all the trains laid for that
terrible explosion; and now its own hand of cruelty brought the torch
to ignite them. Let us, at risk of some iteration, consider some of
these combustible elements.

In the first place the Church had recognised the existence of the
pagan gods and goddesses, not wishing to imbreed in the popular mind a
sceptical habit, and also having use for them to excite terror. Having
for this latter purpose carved and painted them as ugly and bestial,
it became further of importance that they should be represented as
stupid and comparatively impotent. Baptism could exorcise them,
and a crucifix put thousands of them to flight. This tuition was
not difficult. The peasantries of Europe had readily been induced
to associate the newly announced (christian) Devil with their most
mischievous demons. But we have already considered the forces under
which these demons had entered on their decline before they were
associated with Satan. Many conquered obstructions had rendered the
Demons which represented them ridiculous. Hence the 'Dummeteufel' of
so many German fables and of the mediaeval miracle-plays. 'No greater
proof,' says Dr. Dasent, 'can be given of the small hold which the
christian Devil has taken of the Norse mind, than the heathen aspect
under which he constantly appears, and the ludicrous way in which
he is always outwitted.' [156] 'The Germans,' says Max Muller,
'indoctrinated with the idea of a real devil, the Semitic Satan
or Diabolus, treated him in the most good-humoured manner.' [157]
A fair idea of the insignificance he and his angels reached may be
gained from the accompanying picture (Fig. 18), with which a mediaeval
Missal now in possession of Sir Joseph Hooker is illuminated. It could
not be expected that the masses would fear beings whom their priests
thus held up to ridicule. It is not difficult to imagine the process
of evolution by which the horns of such insignificant devils turned
to the asinine ears of such devils as this stall carving at Corbeil,
near Paris (Fig. 19), which represented the popular view of the mastery
obtained by witches over devils. It must be remembered also that this
power over devils was in accordance with the traditions concerning
Solomon, and the subserviency of Oriental demons generally to the
lamps or charms to which they were bound.

What the popular christian devil had become in all the Northern
nations is sufficiently shown in the figure he presented in most
of the old miracle-plays and 'Moralities.' 'The Devill in his
fethers all ragged and rent,' [158] had horns, wide mouth, long
(sometimes up-turned) nose, red beard, cloven foot, and tail. He
was attended by a buffoon called Vice. 'And,' says Harsenet, 'it
was a pretty part in the old Church playes when the nimble Vice
would skip up nimbly like a Jackanapes into the Devil's necke, and
ride the Devil a course, and belabour him with a wooden dagger,
till he made him roar, whereat the people would laugh to see the
Devil so Vice-haunted.' [159] The two must have nearly resembled the
clown and his unhappy victim Pantaloon in our pantomimes, as to their
antics. It would seem that sometimes holy personages were caricatured
in the make-up of the stage-devil. Thus in 'Gammer Gurton's Needle'
we have this conversation:--


  GAMMER. But, Hodge, had he no horns to push?

  HODGE. As long as your two armes. Saw ye never fryer Rushe
  Painted on cloth, with a side long cowe's tayle
  And crooked cloven feet, and many a hooked nayle?
  For all the world (if I should judge) should reckon him his brother;
  Loke, even what face fryer Rushe had, the devil had such another.


In the scene of Christ's delivering souls from purgatory, the Devil
is represented as blowing lustily a horn to alarm his comrades,
and crying, 'Out, out, aronzt!' to the invader. He fights with a
three-pronged fork. He and his victims are painted black, [160] in
contrast with the souls of the saved, which are white. The hair was
considered very important. [161] When he went to battle, even his
fiery nature was sometimes represented in a way that must have been
more ludicrous than impressive. [162]

The insignificance to which the priests had reduced the devil in the
plays, where they were usually the actors, reflected their own petty
routine of life. They could conceive of nothing more terrible than
their own mean mishaps and local obstructions. One great office of the
Devil was to tempt some friar to sleep when he should be at prayer,
[163] make another drink too much, or a third cast warm glances at
a village beauty. The Revelations of the Abbot Richalmus, written
seven hundred years ago, shows the Devil already far gone in his
process of diminution. The Devil here concentrates the energies
which once made the earth tremble on causing nausea to the Abbot,
and making the choir cough while he is preaching. 'When I sit down to
holy studies,' he says, 'the devils make me heavy with sleep. Then I
stretch my hands beyond my cuffs to give them a chill. Forthwith the
spirits prick me under my clothes like so many fleas, which causes me
to put my hands on them; and so they get warm again, and my reading
grows careless.' 'Come, just look at my lip; for twenty years has an
imp clung to it just to make it hang down.' It is ludicrous to find
that ancient characteristic of the gods of Death already adverted
to--their hatred of salt, the agent of preservation--descended from
being the sign of Job's constancy to Jehovah into a mere item of the
Abbot's appetite. 'When I am at dinner, and the devil has taken away my
appetite, as soon as I have tasted a little salt it comes back to me;
and if, shortly afterwards, I lose it again, I take some more salt,
and am once more an hungered.' [164]

One dangerous element was the contempt into which, by many causes,
the infernal powers had been brought. But a more dangerous one lay in
another direction. Though the current phrases of the New Testament
and of the Fathers of the Church, declaring this world, its wealth,
loves, and pleasures, to be all the kingdom of Satan, had become cant
in the mouths of priests ruling over Europe, it had never been cant
to the humble peasantries. Although they had degraded many devils
imported by the priests, it had been in connection with the declining
terrors of their native demonologies. But above these degraded and
hated gnomes and elves, whose paternity had been transferred from
Soetere to Satan, there was an array of beautiful deities--gentle
gods and goddesses traditionally revered and loved as protectors of
the home and the family--which had never really lost their hold on the
common people. They might have shrunk before the aggressive victories
of the Saints into little Fairies, but their continued love for the
poor and the oppressed was the romance of every household. What did
these good fairies do? They sometimes loaded the lowly with wealth,
if summoned in just the right way; they sang secrets to them from
trees as little birds, they smoothed the course of love, clothed
ash-maidens in fine clothes, transported people through the air,
enabled them to render themselves invulnerable, or invisible, to get
out of prisons, to vanquish 'the powers that be,' whether 'ordained of
God' or not. Now all these were benefits which, by christian theory,
could only be conferred by that Prince of this World who ministered to
'the pride of life.'

Into homes which the priest and his noble had stripped of happiness
and hope,--whose loving brides were for baptized Bluebeards, whose
hard earnings were taken as the price of salvation from devils whose
awfulness was departing,--there came from afar rumours of great wealth
and splendour conferred upon their worshippers by Eastern gods and
goddesses. The priests said all those were devils who would torture
their devotees eternally after death; yet it could not be denied
that the Moors had the secret of lustres and ornamentation, that
the heathen East was gorgeous, that all Christendom was dreaming of
the wealth of Ormus and of Ind. Granted that Satan had come westward
and northward, joined the scurvy crew of [[Loki]], and become of little
importance; but what of Baal or Beelzebub, of Asmodeus, of the genii
who built Solomon's temple, of rich Pluto, of august Ahriman? Along
with stories of Oriental magnificence there spread through Christendom
names of many deities and demons; many of them beautiful names, too,
euphemism having generally managed to bestow melodious epithets alike
on deities feared and loved. In Faust's 'Miraculous Art and Book of
Marvels, or the Black Raven' (1469), the infernal heirarchy are thus
named:--King, Lucifer; Viceroy, Belial; Gubernatores, Satan, Beelzebub,
Astaroth, Pluto; Chief Princes, Aziel, Mephistopheles, Marbuel, Ariel,
Aniguel, Anisel, Barfael. Seductive meanings, too, corresponding to
these names, had filtered in some way from the high places they once
occupied into the minds of the people. Lucifer was a fallen star that
might rise again; Belial and Beelzebub were princes of the fire that
rendered possible the arts of man, and the Belfires never went out in
the cold North; Astarte meant beauty, and Pluto wealth; Aziel (Asael)
was President of the great College of occult arts, from whom Solomon
learned the secrets by which he made the jinni his slaves; Marbuel
was the artist and mechanic, sometimes believed to aid artisans who
produced work beyond ordinary human skill; Ariel was the fine spirit
of the air whose intelligence corresponded to that of the Holy Ghost
on the other side; Aniguel is the serpent of Paradise, generally
written Anisel; Anizazel is probably a fanciful relative of Azazel,
'the strong god;' and Barfael, who in a later Faust book is Barbuel,
is an orientalised form of the 'demon of the long beard' who holds
the secret of the philosopher's stone.

In a later chapter the growth of favourable views of the devil is
considered. Some of the legends therein related may be instructively
read in connection with the development of Witchcraft. Many rumours
were spread abroad of kindly assistance brought by demons to persons in
distress. But even more than by hopes so awakened was the witch aided
by the burning desire of the people for vengeance. They wanted Zamiel
(Samael) to help them to mould the bullet that would not miss its
mark. The Devil and all his angels had long been recognised by their
catechists as being utilised by the Deity to execute his vengeance
on the guilty; and to serfs in their agony that devil who would not
spare prince or priest was more desired than even the bestower of
favours to their starving minds and bodies.

Under the long ages of war in Europe, absorbing the energies of men,
women had become the preservers of letters. The era of witchcraft in
Europe found that sex alone able to read and write, arts disesteemed
in men, among the peasantry at least. To them men turned when it had
become a priestly lesson that a few words were more potent than the
weapons of princes. Besides this, women were the chief sorcerers,
because they were the chief sufferers. In Alsace (1615), out of
seventy-five who perished as witches, sixty-two were women. The
famous Malleus Maleficorum, which did more evil than any work ever
published, derives femina from fide minus. Although in the Faust
legend Mephistopheles objects to marriage, many stories represent
diabolical weddings. Particular details were told of the marriage of
Satan with the daughter of a Sorceress at Egnischen (1585), on which
occasion the three towers of the castle there were said to have been
illuminated, and a splendid banquet spread, the favourite dish being
a ragout of bats. There was exquisite music, and a 'beautiful man'
blessed the nuptials. How many poor peasant girls must have had such
dreams as they looked up from their drudgery to the brilliant chateaux?

In the illuminated manuscript known as 'Queen Mary's Psalter' (1553)
there is a picture of the Fall of Man (Fig. 20) which possesses
far-reaching significance. It is a modification of that idea,
which gained such wide currency in the Middle Ages, that it was
the serpent-woman Lilith who had tempted Adam to eat the forbidden
fruit. In this picture, while the beautiful face and ample hair
of Lilith are given, instead of the usual female bust she has the
body of a cat. This nocturnal animal, already sacred to Freyja, the
Teutonic Venus, whose chariot it drew, gained a new mythological
career in the North by the large number of Southern and Oriental
stones which related it to the lunar and amorous demonesses. When
the gods fled before the Titans, Diana, as Ovid relates, changed
herself to a cat, and as infernal Hecate that animal was still
beside her. If my reader will turn to vol. i. p. 130, some of the
vast number of myths which prepared the cat to take its place as
familiar of the witch may be found. Whether the artist had Lilith in
his mind or not, the illumination in 'Queen Mary's Psalter' represents
a remarkable association of myths. For Lilith was forerunner of the
mediaeval mothers weeping for their children; her voice of perpetual
lamentation at the cruel fate allotted her by the combined tyranny
of God and man was heard on every sighing wind; and she was the
richly dressed bride of the Prince of Devils, ever seeking to tempt
youth. Such stories floated through the mind of the Middle Ages,
and this infernal Madonna is here seen in association with the cat,
beneath whose soft sparkling fur the goddess of Love and Beauty was
supposed to be still lurking near the fireside of many a miserable
home. Some fragrance of the mystical East was with this feline beauty,
and nothing can be more striking than the contrast which the ordinary
devils beside her present. Their unseductive ugliness and meanness is
placed out of sight of the pair tempted to seek the fruit of forbidden
knowledge. They inspire the man and woman in their evidently eager
grasping after the fruit, which here means the consultation of fair
fortune-tellers and witches to obtain that occult knowledge for which
speculative men are seeking in secret studies and laboratories.

Those who have paid attention to the subject of Witchcraft need not
be reminded that its complexity and vastness would require a larger
volume than the present to deal with it satisfactorily. The present
study must be limited to a presentation of some of the facts which
induce the writer to believe that, beneath the phenomena, lay a
profound alienation from Christianity, and an effort to recall the
banished gods which it had superseded.

The first christian church was mainly Jewish, and this is also to say
that it inherited the vast Angelolatry and the system of spells which
that tribe had brought from Babylon. To all this was now superadded
the accumulation of Assyrian and Egyptian lore which was re-edited
in the form of Neoplatonicism. This mongrel mass, constituted of
notions crumbled from many systems, acquired a certain consistency
in Gnosticism. The ancient Egyptians had colleges set apart for
astrological study, and for cultivation of the art of healing by
charms. Every month, decade, day of the year had its special guardian
in the heavens. The popular festivals were astronomic. To the priests
in the colleges were reserved study of the sacred books in which
the astrological secrets were contained, and whose authorship was
attributed to the god Thoth, inventor of writing, the Greek Hermes,
and, later, Egyptian Hermes Trismegistus. The zodiac is a memorial of
the influence which the stars were supposed to exert upon the human
body. Alchemy (the word is Egyptian, Kemi meaning 'black earth')
was also studied in connection with solar, lunar, and stellar
influences. The Alchemists dreamed of discovering the philosopher's
stone, which would change base metals to gold; and Diocletian, in
burning the Alchemists' books, believed that, in so doing, he would
deprive the Egyptians of their source of wealth. [165]

Imported into Greece, these notions and their cult had a twofold
development. Among the Platonists they turned to a naturalistic
and allegorical Demonology; among the uncultivated they formed a
Diabolarchy, which gathered around the terrible lunar phantasm--Hecate.

The astrological College of Egypt gave to the Jews their strange
idea of the high school maintained among the devils, already
referred to in connection with Asmodeus, who was one of its leading
professors. The rabbinical legend was, that two eminent angels, Asa
and Asael, remonstrated with the Creator on having formed man only
to give trouble. The Creator said they would have done the same as
man under similar circumstances; whereupon Asa and Asael proposed
that the experiment should be tried. They went to earth, and the
Creator's prediction was fulfilled: they were the first 'sons of God'
who fell in love with the daughters of men (Gen. vi. 2). They were
then embodied. In heaven they had been angels of especial knowledge in
divine arts, and they now used their spells to reascend. But their sin
rendered the spells powerless for that, so they repaired to the Dark
Mountains, and there established a great College of Sorcery. Among the
many distinguished graduates of this College were Job, Jethro, and
Bileam. It was believed that these three instructed the soothsayers
who attempted to rival the miracles of Moses before Pharaoh. Job
and Jethro were subsequently converted, but Bileam continued his
hostility to Israel, and remains a teacher in the College. Through
knowledge of the supreme spell--the Shem-hammphorasch, or real name
of God--Solomon was able to chain Professor Asmodeus, and wrest from
him the secret of the worm Schamir, by whose aid the Temple was built.

Traditions of the learning of the Egyptians, and of the marvels
learned by Solomon from Asa and Asael by which he compelled demons to
serve him, and the impressive story of the Witch of Endor, powerfully
influenced the inquisitive minds of Europe. The fierce denunciations of
all studies of these arts of sorcery by the early Church would alone
reveal how prevalent they were. The wonderful story of Apollonius of
Tyana, [166] as told by Philostratus, was really a kind of gospel to
the more worldly-minded scholars. Some rabbins, following the outcry
against Jesus, 'He casteth out devils by Beelzebub,' circulated at an
early date the story that Jesus had derived his power to work miracles
from the spell Shem-hammphorasch, which he found on one of the stones
of the Temple where Solomon had left it. Though Eusebius cast doubt
upon them, the christians generally do not appear to have denied the
miracles of Apollonius, which precisely copy those of Jesus from the
miraculous birth to the ascension, but even to have quoted them as
an evidence of the possibility of miracles. Celsus having attributed
the miracles of Jesus to sorcery, and said that magic influenced
only the ignorant and immoral, Origen replies that, in order to
convince himself of the contrary, he has only to read the memoirs
of Apollonius by Maeragenes, who speaks of him as a philosopher and
magician, who repeatedly exercised his powers on philosophers. Arnobius
and the fathers of the fourth century generally believed in the
Apollonian thaumaturgy and attributed it to magic. Aldus Manutius
published the book of Philostratus in the fifteenth century, and the
degree to which the fascinating and marvellous stories concerning
Apollonius fired the European imagination just awaking under the
breath of the Renaissance, may be estimated by the fury with which
the 'magician' was anathematised by Pico della Mirandola, Jean Bodin,
and Baronius. The book and the controversy attracted much attention,
and while the priests still continued to charge Apollonius with being a
'magician,' they appear to have perceived that it would have been more
to the point, so far as their real peril was concerned, to have proved
him an impostor. Failing that, Dr. Faustus and his fellow-professors
in the 'black art' were left masters of the situation. The people
had to digest the facts admitted, that a Pagan had learned, by
initiations into the astrological schools of Egypt and India, the
means of healing the sick, raising the dead, flying through the air,
throwing off chains, opening locks, rendering himself invisible,
and discerning the future.

There was a call for some kind of Apollonius, and Faustus arose. Side
by side flourished Luther and Faustus. To Roman Catholic eyes they
were twin sons of the Devil; [167] that they were characteristic
products of one moral age and force appears to me certain, even as
to-day the negations of Science and the revival of 'Spiritualism'
have a common root in radical disbelief of the hereditary dogmas
and forms of so-called religion. It is, however, not surprising that
Protestantism felt as much horror of its bastard brother as Science
has of the ghostly seances. Through the early sixteenth century we
can trace this strange Dr. Faustus ('auspicious,' he had chosen that
name) going about Germany, not omitting Erfurth, and talking in taverns
about his magic arts and powers. More is said of him in the following
chapter; it is sufficient to observe here, and it is the conclusion
of Professor Morley, who has sifted the history with his usual care,
that about him, as a centre of crystallisation, tales ascribed in
the first place to other conjurers arranged themselves, until he
became the popular ideal of one who sought to sound the depths of
this world's knowledge and enjoyments without help from the Church or
its God. The priests did not doubt that this could be done, nor did
the Protestants; they generally agreed that it could be accomplished
at cost of the soul. As angels of the good God must answer to the
formulas of invocation to those who had made a sacramental compact
with their Chief, so was it possible to share a sacrament of Satan,
and by certain invocations summon his infernal angels to obtain the
pleasures of this world of which he is Prince. A thousand years'
experience of the Church had left the poor ready to sign the compact
if they could secure some little earthly joy. As for Heaven, if it
were anything like what its ministers had provided for the poor on
earth, Hell might be preferable after all.

Dr. Wuttke, while writing his recent work on German superstitions, was
surprised to learn that there still exist in France and in Wurtemberg
schools for teaching the Black Art. A priest in the last-named country
wrote him that a boy had confessed to having passed the lower grade of
such a school, but, scared by the horrid ceremonies, had pronounced
some holy words which destroyed the effect of the wicked practices,
and struck the assembled Devil-worshippers with consternation. The
boy said he had barely escaped with his life. I have myself passed an
evening at a school in London 'for the development of Spirit-mediums,'
and possibly Dr. Wuttke's correspondent would describe these also
as Devil-worshippers. No doubt all such circles might be traced
archaeologically to that Sorcerers' College said by the rabbins to
have been kept by Asa and Asael. But what moral force preserved
them? They do but represent a turning of methods made familiar by
the Church to coax benefits from other supernatural powers in the
hope that they would be less dilatory than the Trinity in bestowing
their gifts. What is the difference between St. Wolfram's God and King
Radbot's Devil? The one offers a golden mansion on earth warranted to
last through eternity, the other a like mansion in the skies receivable
after death. The Saint agrees that if Radbot's Devil can build him such
a house the king would be quite right to worship the architect. The
question of the comparative moral merits of the two invisible Powers
is not mentioned. This legend, related in a preceding chapter,
is characteristic of the motives to which the priesthood appealed
through the Middle Ages. It is no wonder that the people began to
appeal to the gods of their traditional Radbots, nor that they should
have used the ceremonial and sacramental formulas around them.

But to these were added other formulas borrowed from different
sources. The 'Compact with the Devil' had in it various elements. It
appears to have been a custom of the Odinistic religion for men to sign
acts of self-dedication to trusted deities, somewhat corresponding
to the votive tablets of Southern religion. It was a legend of
[[Odin]] that when dying he marked his arm with the point of a spear,
and this may have been imitated. In the 'Mysteries' of pagan and
christian systems blood played an important part--the human blood of
earlier times being symbolised by that of animals, and ultimately,
among christians, in wine of the Eucharist. The primitive history of
this blood-covenant is given in another chapter. Some astrological
formulas, and many of the deities invoked, spread through Europe with
the Jews. The actual, and quite as often fabulous, wealth of that
antichristian race was ascribed to Antichrist, and while christian
princes thought of such gold as legitimate spoil, the honest peasants
sought from their astrologers the transmitted 'key of Solomon,' in
virtue of which the demons served him. The famous 'Compact' therefore
was largely of christian-judaic origin, and only meant conveyance of
the soul in consideration of precisely the same treasures as those
promised by the Church to all whose names were written in the Lamb's
Book,--the only difference being in the period when redemption of
the respective issues of priest and astrologer should fall due. One
was payable during this life, the other after death.

The ceremonial performances of Witchcraft have also always existed
in some form. What we are familiar with of late as Spirit-seances
are by no means new. More than a hundred years ago, Mr. Wesley and
various clergymen were sitting at a table in Cock Lane, asking the
spirit 'Fanny' to rap twice if she were 'in a state of progressive
happiness.' Nay, a hundred years before that (1661), Sir Thomas
Chamberlain and others, sitting in a haunted house at Tedworth, Wilts,
asked 'Satan, if the Drummer set thee to work, give three knocks,
and no more, which it did very distinctly, and stopped.' [168] We
also learn that, in another town and case (1654), 'a naked arm and
hand appeared and beat the floor.' It would not be difficult to go
further back and find that the dark circle of our Spiritualists with
much of its apparatus has existed continuously through the Middle
Ages. The dark seance which Goethe has represented in Faust, Part
II., at which the spirits of Helen and Paris are evoked, is a very
accurate picture of the 'materialisations' now exhibited by mediums,
more than forty years after its publication. These outer resemblances
are physiognomical. The seance of to-day has lost the darker features
of its mediaeval prototype, because the Present has not a real and
temporal, but only a speculative and sentimental despair, and this is
the kind that possesses chiefly the well-to-do and idle classes. It is
not difficult to meet the eye of our everyday human nature amid those
frenzied periods when whole districts seemed afflicted with epidemic
madness, and look deep in that eye to the fathomless heart of humanity.

In an old parish register of Fewston, Yorkshire, are the following
entries:--'1621. Anne, daughter of Edward Fairfax, baptized the 12th
June.' '1621. Edward Fairfax, Esq., a child named Anne, buried the
9th October.' Then in the History of Knaresborough we read of this
child, 'She was held to have died through witchcraft.' In what dreams
did that child, supposed to have been snatched away by diabolic
malice, return as a pure spirit uplifted in light, yet shadowed by
the anxiety and pain of the bereaved family! A medium is at hand,
one through whose mind and heart all the stormy electricities
of the time are playing. The most distinguished representative
of the Fairfax family is off fighting for Parliament against the
King. Edward Fairfax is a zealous Churchman. His eldest daughter,
Helen, aged twenty-one, is a parishioner of the Rev. Mr. Smithson, yet
she has come under the strong influence of a Nonconformist preacher,
Mr. Cook. The scholarly clergyman and his worldly Church on one side,
and the ignorant minister with his humble followers on the other,
are unconscious personifications of Vice and Virtue, while between
them poor Helen is no Heraklea.

Nineteen days after the burial of her little sister Anne, as mentioned
above, Helen is found 'in a deadly trance.' After a little she begins
to speak, her words showing that she is, by imagination, 'in the church
at Leeds, hearing a sermon by Mr. Cook.' On November 3, as she lies on
her bed, Helen exclaims, 'A white cat hath been long upon me and drawn
my breath, and hath left in my mouth and throat so filthy a smell that
it doth poison me!' Next we have the following in the father's diary:
'Item. Upon Wednesday, the 14th of November, she saw a black dog by her
bedside, and, after a little sleep, she had an apparition of one like
a young gentleman, very brave, his apparel all laid with gold lace,
a hat with a golden band, and a ruff in fashion. He did salute her
with the same compliment as she said Sir Fernandino Fairfax useth when
he cometh to the house and saluteth her mother.... He said he was a
Prince, and would make her Queen of England and of all the world if
she would go with him. She refused, and said, 'In the name of God,
what art thou?' He presently did forbid her to name God; to which
she replied, 'Thou art no man if thou canst not abide the name of
God; but if thou be a man, come near, let me feel of thee;' which he
would not do, but said, 'It is no matter for feeling.' She proceeded,
'If thou wert a man, thou wouldst not deny to be felt; but thou art
the devil, and art but a shadow.'

It is possible that Helen Fairfax had read in Shakspere's 'Lear,'
printed twelve years before, that


            The Prince of Darkness is a gentleman;
            Modo he's called, and Mahu. [169]


But the reader will remark how her vision anticipates that of Faust,
the transformation of the poodle to finely-dressed Mephistopheles. On
the next apparition a bit from Patmos is interpolated, the Devil
appearing as a beast with many horns; but the folklore of Yorkshire
prevails, and 'presently he was like a very little dog, and desired
her to open her mouth and let him come into her body, and then he
would rule all the world.' Lastly, he 'filled the room with fire.'

In the account thus far we have the following items of ancient
mythology:--1, the Cat; 2, the Dog; 3, the Pride of Life (Asmodeus),
represented in the fine dress and manners of the fiend; 4, the
Prince of this World, offering its throne; 5, the Egyptian belief
in potency of the Name; 6, the Hunger-Demon, who dares not be felt,
because his back is hollow, and, though himself a shadow, casts none;
7, the disembodied devil of the rabbins, who seeks to enter a human
form, in order to enjoy the higher powers of which man is capable;
8, the fiend of fire.

The period in which Helen Fairfax lived supplied forms for the
'materialisation' of these notions flitting from the ancient cemeteries
of theology. The gay and gallant Asmodeus had been transformed into a
goat under the ascetic eye of Europe; his mistress is a naked witch;
her familiar and slave is a cat. This is the conventionalised theologic
theory, as we find it in many examples, one of which is here shown
(Fig. 21), as copied from a stone panel at the entrance of Lyons
Cathedral. This is what Helen's visions end in. She and her younger
sister of seven years, and a young neighbour, a girl of twelve, who
have become infected with Helen's hysterics, identify six poor women
as witches, and Edward Fairfax would have secured their execution
had it not been for the clergyman Smithson.

Cats played a large part in this as in other witch-trials. They
had long been regarded as an insurance of humble households. In
many regions still may be found beliefs that a three-coloured cat
protects against fire; a black cat cures epilepsy, protects gardens;
and in Bohemia a cat is the favourite bridal gift to procure a happy
wedded life. One who kills a cat has no luck for seven years. The
Yorkshire women called witches remembered these proverbs to their
cost. Among the cats regarded by the Fairfaxes as familiars of the
accused, some names are notable. One is called 'Gibbe.' This is the
Icelandic gabba, to 'delude,' and our gibber; it is the 'Gib' cat of
Reinicke Fuchs, and of the 'Romaunt of the Rose.' In 'Gammer Gurton'
we read, 'Hath no man gelded Gyb, her cat;' and in Henry IV. i. 2,
'I am as melancholy as a gib cat.' Another of the cats is called
Inges. That is, ignis, fire--Agni maintaining his reign of terror.

Helen's devil hates the dissenter, and says, 'Cook is a lying villain,'
because Cook exorcises him with a psalm. On the other hand, the
devil praises the clergyman, but Helen breaks out with 'He is not
worthy to be a vicar who will bear with witches.' Amid the religious
controversies then exciting all households, mourning for his dead
child, humiliated by the suspicions of his best neighbours that
his daughter was guilty of deception, Edward Fairfax, Gentleman,
a scholar and author, lent an ear to the vulgar superstitions of
his neighbourhood. Could he have stood on the shoulders of Grimm,
he would have left us a very different narrative than that preserved
by the Philobiblion Society. [170]

It is hardly possible to determine now the value of the alleged
confessions of witches. They were extorted by torture or by promises
of clemency (the latter rarely fulfilled); they were shaped by
cross-examiners rather than by their victims; and their worth is still
more impaired where, as is usual, they are not given in detail, but
recorded in 'substance,' the phraseology in such case reflecting the
priest's preconceived theory of witches and their orgies. It is to be
feared, for instance, that 'devil' is often written instead of some
name that might now be interesting. Nevertheless, there seems to be
ground for believing that in many cases there were seances held to
invoke supernatural powers.

Among the vast number of trials and confessions, I have found none
more significant than the following. In February 1691 a daughter
and niece of Mr. [[Parris]], minister in Salem (Massachusetts), girls of
ten or eleven years, and several other girls, complained of various
bodily torments, and as the physicians could find no cause for them,
they were pronounced bewitched. The Rev. Mr. [[Parris]] had once been
in business at the Barbadoes, and probably brought thence his two
slaves, Spanish Indians, man and wife. When the children were declared
bewitched, the Indian woman, Tituba, tried an experiment, probably with
fetishes familiar in the Barbadoes, to find out the witch. Whereupon
the children cried out against the Indian woman as appearing to them
and tormenting them. Tituba said her mistress, in her own country,
had taught her how to find out a witch, but denied being one herself;
but afterwards (urged, as she subsequently declared, by her master)
she confessed; and the marks of Spanish cruelty on her body were
assumed to be the Devil's wounds. The Rev. Mr. [[Parris]] in a calmer time
might have vindicated poor Tituba by taking for text of his sermon on
the subject Christ's saying about a house divided against itself, and
reminding the colony, which held public fast against Satan, that the
devil was too clever to cover his Salem agent with wounds; but instead
of that he preached on the words, 'Have I not chosen you twelve, and
one of you is a devil.' During this sermon a woman left the church;
she was sister of a woman who had also been accused by the children,
and, being offended by something Mr. [[Parris]] said, went out of meeting;
of course, also to prison. There were three other women involved with
Tituba, in whose fetish experiments a well-informed writer thinks the
Salem delusion began. [171] The examination before the Deputy-Governor
(Danforth) began at Salem, April 11, 1692, and there are several
notable points in it. Tituba's husband, the Indian John, cunningly
escaped by pretending to be one of the afflicted. He charged Goody
Proctor, and said, 'She brought the book to me.' No one asked what
book! Abigail Williams, also one of the accusers of Goody, was asked,
'Does she bring the book to you? A. Yes. Q. What would she have you do
with it? A. To write in it, and I shall be well.' Not a descriptive
word is demanded or given concerning this book. The examiners are
evidently well acquainted with it. In the alleged confessions preserved
in official reports, but not in the words of the accused, the nature
of the book is made clear. Thus Mary Osgood 'confesses that about
eleven years ago, when she was in a melancholy state and condition,
she used to walk abroad in her orchard, and, upon a certain time she
saw the appearance of a cat at the end of the house, which yet she
thought was a real cat. However, at that time it diverted her from
praying to God, and instead thereof she prayed to the Devil; about
which time she made a covenant with the Devil, who, as a black man,
came to her, and presented her a book, upon which she laid her finger,
and that left a red spot. And that upon her signing that book, the
devil told her that he was her god.' This is not unlikely to be a
paraphrase of some sermon on the infernal Book of Satan corresponding
to the Book of Life, the theory being too conventional for the court
to inquire about the mysterious volume. Equally well known was the
Antichrist theory which had long represented that avatar of Satan
as having organised a church. Thus we read:--'Abigail Williams,
did you see a company at Mr. [[Parris]]'s house eat and drink? A. Yes,
sir; that was their sacrament. Q. What was it? A. They said it was
our blood.' 'Mary Walcot, have you seen a white man? A. Yes, sir,
a great many times. Q. What sort of man was he? A. A fine grave man,
and when he came he made all the witches to tremble.' When it is
remembered that Mary Osgood had described the Devil as 'a black man'
(all were thinking of the Indians), this Antiblackman suggests Christ
resisting Antichrist. Again, although nothing seems to have been said
in the court previously about baptism, one of the examiners asks 'Goody
Laccy how many years ago since they were baptized? A. Three or four
years ago I suppose. Q.  Who baptized them? A. The old serpent. Q. How
did he do it? A. He dipped their heads in the water, saying they
were his, and that he had power over them; ... there were six (who)
baptized. Q. Name them. A. I think they were of the higher powers.'

There are interspersed through the proceedings suggestions of mercy on
condition of confession, which, joined to these theoretical questions,
render it plain that the retractations which the so-called witches
made were true, and that in New England, at least, there was little
if any basis for the delusion beyond the experiment of the two Spanish
Indians. The terrible massacre of witches which occurred there was the
result of the decision of English judges and divines that witchcraft
is recognised in the Bible, and there assigned the death-penalty.

It will be observed here that ancient mythology to Salem is chiefly
that of the Bible, modified by local conditions. White man and black
man represent Christ and Antichrist, and we have the same symbols on
both sides,--eucharists, baptisms, and names written in books. The
survivals from European folklore met with in the New England trials
are--the cat, the horse (rarely), and the dog. In one case a dog
suffered from the repute of being a witch, insomuch that some who
met him fell into fits; he was put to death. Riding through the air
continues, but the American witches ride upon a stick or pole. The
old-fashioned broom, the cloud-symbol of the Wild Huntsman, is
rarely mentioned. One thing, however, survives from England, at
least; the same sharp controversy that is reflected in the Fairfax
case. Cotton Mather tried one of the possessed with the Bible, the
'Assembly's Catechism,' his grandfather's 'Milk for Babes,' his
father's 'Remarkable Providence,' and a book to prove there were
witches. 'And when any of those were offered for her to read in,
she would be struck dead and fall into convulsions.' But when he
tried her with Popish and Quaker books, the English Prayer-Book,
and a book to prove there were no witches, the devil permitted her
to read these as long as she pleased. One is at a loss which most to
admire, the astuteness of the accused witch in bearing testimony to
the Puritan religion, or the phenomenon of its eminent representative
seeking a witness to it in the Father of lies.

If now we travel towards the East we find the survivals growing
clearer, as in the West they become faint.

In 1669 the people of the villages of Mohra and Elfdale in Sweden,
believing that they were troubled by witches, were visited by a royal
commission, the result of whose investigations was the execution of
twenty-three adults and fifteen children; running of the gauntlet by
thirty-six between the ages of nine and sixteen years; the lashing
on the hand of twenty children for three Sundays at the church-door,
and similar lashing of the aforesaid thirty-six once a week for a
year. Portions of the confessions of the witches are given below
from the Public Register as translated by Anthony Horneck, D.D.,
and printed in London, anno 1700. I add a few words in brackets to
point out survivals.

'We of the province of Elfdale do confess that we used to go to a
gravel-pit which lay hard by a cross-way (Hecate), and there we put
on a vest (Wolf-girdle) over our heads, and then danced round, and
after this ran to the cross-way, and called the Devil thrice, first
with a still voice, the second time somewhat louder, and the third
time very loud, with these words--Antecessor, come and carry us to
Blockula. Whereupon immediately he used to appear, but in different
habits; but for the most part we saw him in a grey coat and red and
blue stockings: he had a red beard (Barbarossa), a high-crowned hat
(Turn-cap), with linen of divers colours wrapt about it, and long
garters upon his stockings.

'Then he asked us whether we would serve him with soul and body. If we
were content to do so, he set us upon a beast which he had there ready,
and carried us over churches and high walls; and after all we came
to a green meadow where Blockula lies. We must procure some scrapings
of altars, and filings of church clocks; and then he gives us a horn
with a salve in it, wherewith we do anoint ourselves (chrism); and a
saddle with a hammer ([[Thor]]'s), and a wooden nail, thereby to fix the
saddle (Walkyr's); whereupon we call upon the Devil and away we go.'

'For their journey, they said they made use of all sorts of
instruments, of beasts, of men, of spits, and posts, according as they
had opportunity: if they do ride upon goats (Azazel) and have many
children with them, that all may have room, they stick a spit into
the backside of the Goat, and then are anointed with the aforesaid
ointment. What the manner of their journey is, God only knows. Thus
much was made out, that if the children did at any time name the
names (Egyptian spells) of those that had carried them away, they
were again carried by force either to Blockula, or to the cross-way,
and there miserably beaten, insomuch that some of them died of it.'

'A little girl of Elfdale confessed that, naming the name of Jesus
as she was carried away, she fell suddenly upon the ground, and got
a great hole in her side, which the Devil presently healed up again,
and away he carried her; and to this day the girl confessed she had
exceeding great pain in her side.'

'They unanimously confessed that Blockula is situated in a delicate
large meadow, whereof you can see no end. The place or house they
met at had before it a gate painted with divers colours; through
this gate they went into a little meadow distinct from the other,
where the beasts went that they used to ride on; but the men whom
they made use of in their journey stood in the house by the gate in a
slumbering posture, sleeping against the wall (castle of Waldemar). In
a huge large room of this house, they said, there stood a very long
table, at which the witches did sit down; and that hard by this
room was another chamber where there were very lovely and delicate
beds. The first thing they must do at Blockula was, that they must
deny all, and devote themselves body and soul to the Devil, and
promise to serve him faithfully, and confirm all this with an oath
(initiation). Hereupon they cut their fingers (Odinism), and with
their blood write their name in his book (Revelations). They added
that he caused them to be baptized, too, by such priests as he had
there (Antichrist's Sacraments).'

'And he, the Devil, bids them believe that the day of judgment will
come speedily, and therefore sets them on work to build a great house
of stone (Babel), promising that in that house he will preserve them
from God's fury, and cause them to enjoy the greatest delights and
pleasures (Moslem). But while they work exceeding hard at it, there
falls a great part of the wall down again.'

'They said, they had seen sometimes a very great Devil like a Dragon,
with fire round about him, and bound with an iron chain (Apocalyptic),
and the Devil that converses with them tells them that if they confess
anything he will let that great Devil loose upon them, whereby all
Sweedeland shall come into great danger.

'They added that the Devil had a church there, such another as in
the town of Mohra. When the Commissioners were coming he told the
Witches they should not fear them; for he would certainly kill them
all. And they confessed that some of them had attempted to murther
the Commissioners, but had not been able to effect it.

'Some of the children talked much of a white [[Angel]] (Frigga as christian
tutelary), which used to forbid them what the Devil had bid them do,
and told them that those doings should not last long. What had been
done had been permitted because of the wickedness of the people.

'Those of Elfdale confessed that the Devil used to play upon an
harp before them (Tannhauser), and afterwards to go with them that
he liked best into a chamber, when he committed venerous acts with
them (Asmodeus); and this indeed all confessed, that he had carnal
knowledge of them, and that the Devil had sons and daughters by them,
which he did marry together, and they ... brought forth toads and
serpents (Echidna).

'After this they sat down to table, and those that the Devil esteemed
most were placed nearest to him; but the children must stand at the
door, where he himself gives them meat and drink (Sacrament). After
meals they went to dancing, and in the meanwhile swore and cursed
most dreadfully, and afterwards went to fighting one with another
(Valhalla).

'They also confessed that the Devil gives them a beast about the
bigness and shape of a young cat (Hecate), which they call a carrier;
and that he gives them a bird as big as a raven ([[Odin]]'s messenger),
but white; [172] and these two creatures they can send anywhere, and
wherever they come they take away all sorts of victuals they can get,
butter, cheese, milk, bacon, and all sorts of seeds, whatever they
find, and carry it to the witch. What the bird brings they may keep
for themselves, but what the carrier brings they must reserve for the
Devil, and that is brought to Blockula, where he doth give them of it
so much as he thinks fit. They added likewise that these carriers fill
themselves so full sometimes, that they are forced to spue ('[[Odin]]'s
booty') by the way, which spuing is found in several gardens, where
colworts grow, and not far from the houses of these witches. It is
of a yellow colour like gold, and is called butter of witches.

'The Lords Commissioners were indeed very earnest, and took great pains
to persuade them to show some of their tricks, but to no purpose;
for they did all unanimously confess that since they had confessed
all, they found that all their witchcraft was gone, and that the
Devil at this time appeared to them very terrible, with claws on
his hands and feet, and with horns on his head, a long tail behind,
and showed to them a pit burning, with a hand put out; but the Devil
did thrust the person down again with an iron fork; and suggested to
the witches that if they continued in their confession, he would deal
with them in the same manner.'

The ministers of both Elfdale and Mohra were the chief inciters of
this investigation, and both testified that they had suffered many
tortures in the night from the witches. One was taken by the throat
and so violently used that 'for some weeks he was not able to speak
or perform divine service.'

We have in this narrative the official and clerical statement, and can
never know to what the victims really confessed. Blockula seems to be
a Swedish edition of Blocksberg, of old considered a great resort of
witches. But we may especially note the epithet by which the witches
are said to have first appealed to the Devil--Antecessor. Dr. Horneck
has not given us the Swedish term of which this is a translation,
but we may feel assured that it was not a phrase coined by the class
among whom reputed witches were found. In all probability it was a
learned phrase of the time for some supposed power which preceded
and was conquered by Christianity; and if we knew its significance it
might supply a clue to the reality with which the Commissioners were
dealing. There would seem to be strong probabilities that in Sweden
also, as elsewhere, there had been a revival of faith in the old
religion whose barbaric rites had still survived in a few holes and
corners where they were practised by night. The Antecessor was still
present to hold out promises where the Successor had broken all that
his sponsors had made when the populace accepted his baptism. This
probability is further suggested by the fact that some of these
uncanny events happened at Elfdale, a name which hints at a region of
especial sanctity under the old religion, and also by the statement
that the Devil had a church there, a sort of travesty of the village
church. About the same time we find John Fiene confessing in Scotland
that the Devil appeared to him in 'white raiment,' and it is also
testified that John heard 'the Devil preach in a kirk in the pulpit
in the night by candlelight, the candle burning blue.' [173]

The names used by the Scotch witches are often suggestive of
pagan survivals. Thus in the trial at the Paisley Assizes, 1678,
concerning the alleged bewitching of Sir George Maxwell, Margaret
Jackson testified to giving up her soul by renouncing her baptism to
a devil named Locas ([[Loki]]?); another raised a tempest to impede the
king's voyage to Denmark by casting into the sea a cat, and crying
Hola (Hela?); and Agnes Sampson called the Devil to her in the shape
of a dog by saying, 'Elva (Elf?), come and speak to me!'

It is necessary to pass by many of the indications contained in the
witch-trials that there had been an effort to recur to the pleasures
and powers traditionally associated with the pagan era of Europe, and
confirmed by the very denunciations of contemporary paganism with its
pomp and luxury by the priesthood. The promises held out by the 'Devil'
to Elfdale peasants and puritanised Helen Fairfax are unmistakable. But
it is necessary to remark also that the ceremonies by which, as was
clearly proved in various cases, the fortune-tellers or 'witches'
endeavoured to imitate the spells of Dr. Faustus were archaeological.

Around the cauldron, which was used in imitation of the Alchemists,
a rude Zodiac was marked, some alchemic signs being added; and
in the cauldron were placed ingredients concerning many of which
the accounts are confused. It is, however, certain that the chief
ingredients were plants which, precisely as in ancient Egypt, had
been gathered at certain phases of the moon, or seasons of the year,
or from some spot where the sun was supposed not to have shone on
it. It was clearly proved also that the plants chiefly used by the
sorceresses were rue and vervain. Vervain was sacred to the god of war
in Greece and Rome, and made the badge of ambassadors sent to make
treaties of peace. In Germany it was sacred to [[Thor]], and he would
not strike with his lightning a house protected by it. The Druids
called it 'holy herb;' they gathered it when the dog-star rose, from
unsunned spots, and compensated the earth for the deprivation with
a sacrifice of honey. Its reputation was sufficient in Ben Jonson's
day for him to write--


        Bring your garlands, and with reverence place
        The vervain on the altar.


The charm which vervain had for the mediaeval peasant was that it
was believed, if it had first touched a Bel-fire, to snap iron; and,
if boiled with rue, made a liquid which, being poured on a gunflint,
made the shot as sure to take effect as any Freischutz could desire.

Rue was supposed to have a potent effect on the eye, and to bestow
second sight. So sacred was it once in England that missionaries
sprinkled holy water from brushes made up of it, whence it was called
'herb of grace.' Milton represents Michael as purging Adam's eyes
with it. In the Tyrol it is believed to confer fine vision and used
with agrimony (flowers of Argos, the many-eyed); in Posen it is said
also to heal serpent-bites. By this route it came into the cauldron
of the wizard and witch. In Drayton's incantation it is said--


            Then sprinkles she the juice of rue,
            With nine drops of the midnight dew
            From lunary distilling.


This association of lunary, or moon-wort, once supposed to cure lunacy,
with rue is in harmony with the mythology of both. An old oracle,
said to have been revealed by Hecate herself, ran thus:--'From a
root of wild rue fashion and polish a statue; adorn it with household
lizards; grind myrrh, gum, and frankincense with the same reptiles,
and let the mixture stand in the air during the waning of a moon;
then address your vows in the following terms' (the formula is not
preserved). 'As many forms as I have, so many lizards let there be;
do these things exactly; you will build me an abode with branches of
laurel, and having addressed fervent prayers to the image, you will
see me in your sleep.' [174]

Rue was thus consecrated as the very substance of Hecate, the mother
of all European witches. M. Maury supposes that it was because it was
a narcotic and caused hallucinations. Hallucinations were, no doubt,
the basis of belief in second sight. But whatever may be the cause,
rue was the plant of witchcraft; and Bishop Taylor speaks of its being
used by exorcists to try the devil, and thence deriving its appellation
'herb of grace.' More probably it was used to sprinkle holy water
because of a traditional sanctity. All narcotics were supposed to be
children of the night; and if, in addition, they were able to cause
hallucinations, they were supposed to be under more especial care of
the moon.

After reading a large number of reports concerning the ordeals and
trials of witches, and also many of their alleged confessions, I have
arrived at the conclusion that there were certainly gatherings held
in secret places; that some of the ordinary ceremonies and prayers of
the Church were used, with names of traditional deities and Oriental
demons substituted for those of the Trinity and saints; that with
these were mingled some observances which had been preserved from
the ancient world by Gnostics, Astrologists, and Alchemists. That at
these gatherings there was sometimes direct devil-worship is probable,
but oftener the invocations were in other names, and it is for the
most part due to the legal reporters that the 'Devil' is so often
named. As to the 'confessions,' many, no doubt, admitted they had
gone to witches' Sabbaths who had been there only in feverish dreams,
as must have been the case of many young children and morbid pietists
who were executed; others confessed in hope of escape from charges
they could not answer; and others were weary of their lives.

The writer of this well remembers, in a small Virginian village
(Falmouth), more than thirty years ago, the terrible persecutions to
which an old white woman named Nancy Calamese was subjected because
of her reputation as a witch. Rumours of lizards vomited by her poor
neighbours caused her to be dreaded by the ignorant; the negroes
were in terror of her; she hardly dared pass through the streets
for fear of being hooted by boys. One morning she waded into the
Rappahannock river and drowned herself, and many of her neighbours
regarded the suicide as her confession. Probably it was a similar
sort of confession to many that we read in the reports of witch trials.

The retribution that followed was more ferocious than could have
visited mere attempts by the poor and ignorant to call up spirits
to their aid. Every now and then the prosecutions disclose the
well-known animus of heresy, persecution, and also the fury of
magistrates suspicious of conspiracies. In England, New England,
and France, particularly, an incipient rationalism was revealed
in the party called 'Saducees,' who tried to cast discredit on
the belief in witchcraft. This was recognised by Sir Mathew Hale
in England and Cotton Mather in New England, consequently by the
chief authorities of church and state in both countries, as an
attack on biblical infallibility, since it was said in the Bible,
'Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.' The leading wizards and
witches were probably also persons who had been known in connection
with the popular discontent and revolutionary feeling displayed in
so many of the vindictive conjurations which were brought to light.

The horrors which attended the crushing out of this last revival
of paganism are such as recall the Bartholomew massacre and the
recent slaughter of Communists in Paris, so vividly that one can
hardly repress the suspicion that the same sort of mingled panic and
fanaticism were represented in them all. Dr. Reville has summed up the
fearful history of three hundred years as follows:--'In the single
year 1485, and in the district of Worms alone, eighty-five witches
were delivered to the flames. At Geneva, at Basle, at Hamburg,
at Ratisbon, at Vienna, and in a multitude of other towns, there
were executions of the same kind. At Hamburg, among other victims,
a physician was burnt alive, because he saved the life of a woman
who had been given up by the midwife. In Italy, during the year
1523, there were burnt in the diocese of Como alone more than two
hundred witches. This was after the new bull hurled at witchcraft
by Pope Adrian VI. In Spain it was still worse; there, in 1527,
two little girls, of from nine to eleven years of age, denounced a
host of witches, whom they pretended to detect by a mark in their
left eye. In England and Scotland political influence was brought to
bear upon sorcery; Mary Stuart was animated by a lively zeal against
witches. In France the Parliament of Paris happily removed business
of this kind from the ecclesiastical tribunals; and under Louis XI.,
Charles VIII., and Louis XII. there were but few condemnations for
the practice of magic; but from the time of Francis I., and especially
from Henry II., the scourge reappeared. Jean Bodin, a man of sterling
worth in other respects, but stark mad upon the question of witchcraft,
communicated his mania to all classes of the nation. His contemporary
and disciple, Boguet, showed how that France swarmed with witches and
wizards. 'They increase and multiply on the land,' said he, 'even as do
the caterpillars in our gardens. Would that they were all got together
in a heap, so that a single fire might burn them all at once.' Savoy,
Flanders, the Jura Mountains, Lorraine, Bearn, Provence, and in almost
all parts of France, the frightful hecatombs were seen ablaze. In the
seventeenth century the witch-fever somewhat abated, though it burst
out here and there, centralising itself chiefly in the convents of
hysterical nuns. The terrible histories of the priests Gaufridy and
Urban Grandier are well known. In Germany, and particularly in its
southern parts, witch-burning was still more frequent. In one small
principality at least 242 persons were burnt between 1646 and 1651;
and, horribile dictu, in the official records of these executions,
we find that among those who suffered were children from one to six
years of age! In 1657 the witch-judge, Nicholas Remy, boasted of having
burnt 900 persons in fifteen years. It would even seem that it is to
the proceedings against sorcery that Germany owes the introduction
of torture as an ordinary mode of getting at the truth. Mr. Roskoff
reproduces a catalogue of the executions of witches and wizards in
the episcopal town of Wurzburg, in Bavaria, up to the year 1629. In
1659 the number of those put to death for witchcraft amounted, in
this diocese, to 900. In the neighbouring bishopric of Bamberg at
least 600 were burnt. He enumerates thirty-one executions in all,
not counting some regarded by the compilers of the catalogue as not
important enough to mention. The number of victims at each execution
varies from two to seven. Many are distinguished by such surnames
as 'The Big Hunchback, The Sweetheart, The Bridge-keeper, The Old
Pork-woman,' &c. Among them appear people of all sorts and conditions,
actors, workmen, jugglers, town and village maidens, rich burghers,
nobles, students, magistrates even, and a fair number of priests. Many
are simply entered as 'a foreigner.' Here and there is added to the
name of the condemned person his age and a short notice. Among the
victims, for instance, of the twentieth execution figures 'Little
Barbara, the prettiest girl in Wurzburg;' 'a student who could speak
all manner of languages, who was an excellent musician, vocaliter et
instrumentaliter;' 'the master of the hospice, a very learned man.' We
find, too, in this, gloomy account the cruel record of children burnt
for witchcraft; here a little girl of about nine or ten years of age,
with her baby sister, younger than herself (their mother was burnt a
little while afterwards); here boys of ten or eleven; again, a young
girl of fifteen; two children from the poorhouse; the little boy of
a councillor. The pen falls from one's hand in recapitulating such
monstrosities. Cannot those who would endow Catholicity with the
dogma of papal infallibility hearken, before giving their vote,
to the cries that rise before God, and which history re-echoes,
of those poor innocent ones whom pontifical bulls threw into
flames? The seventeenth century saw the rapid diminution of trials
and tortures. In one of his good moments, Louis XIV. mitigated greatly
the severity of this special legislation. For this he had to undergo
the remonstrances of the Parliament of Rouen, which believed society
would be ruined if those who dealt in sorcery were merely condemned to
perpetual confinement. The truth is, that belief in witchcraft was so
wide-spread, that from time to time even throughout the seventeenth
century there were isolated executions. One of the latest and most
notorious was that of Renata Saenger, superior of the convent of
Unterzell, near Wurzburg (1748). At Landshut, in Bavaria, in 1756,
a young girl of thirteen years was convicted of impure intercourse
with the Devil, and put to death. Seville in 1781, and Glaris in 1783,
saw the last two known victims to this fatal superstition.' [175]

The Reformation swept away in Northern countries, for the upper
classes, as many Christian saints and angels as priestcraft had
previously turned to enemies for the lower. The poor and ignorant
simply tried to evoke the same ideal spirit-guardians under the
pagan forms legendarily associated with a golden age. Witchcraft
was a pathetic appeal against a cruel present to a fair, however
visionary, past. But Protestantism has brought on famine of another
kind--famine of the heart. The saints of the Church have followed those
of paganism; and although one result of the process has been a vast
increase in enterprise, science, and wealth, man cannot live by these
alone. Modern spiritualism, which so many treat with a superciliousness
little creditable to a scientific age, is a cry of starved sentiment
and affections left hopeless under faded heavens, as full of pathetic
meaning as that which was wrung from serfs enticed into temples only
to find them dens of thieves. Desolate hearts take up the burthen
of desolate homes, and appeal to invisible powers for guidance;
and for attestation of hopes which science has blighted, ere poetry,
art, and philanthropy have changed these ashes into beauty. Because
these so-called spirits, evoked by mediums out of morbid nerves,
are really longed-for ideals, the darker features of witchcraft are
not called about them. That fearful movement was a wronged Medea
whose sorrows had made Hecate--to remember the dreadful phrase of
Euripides--'the chosen assistant dwelling in the inmost recesses of
her house.' Modern spiritualism is Rachel weeping for her children,
not to be comforted if they are not. But the madness of the one is
to be understood by the plaintive appeal of the other.







CHAPTER XXV.

FAUST AND MEPHISTOPHELES.

Mephisto and Mephitis--The Raven Book--Papal sorcery--Magic
seals--Mephistopheles as dog--George Sabellicus alias Faustus--The
Faust myth--Marlowe's Faust--Good and evil angels--El Magico
Prodigioso--Cyprian and Justina--Klinger's Faust--Satan's
sermon--Goethe's Mephistopheles--His German characters--Moral
scepticism--Devil's gifts--Helena--Redemption through Art--Defeat
of Mephistopheles.


The name Mephistopheles has in it, I think, the priest's shudder at
the fumes of the laboratory. Duntzer [176] finds that the original
form of the word was 'Mephostophiles,' and conjectures that it was a
bungling effort to put together three Greek words, to mean 'not loving
the light.' In this he has the support of Bayard Taylor, who also
thinks that it was so understood by Goethe. The transformation of it
was probably amid the dreaded gases with which the primitive chemist
surrounded himself. He who began by 'not loving the light' became the
familiar of men seeking light, and lover of their mephitic gases. The
ancient Romans had a mysterious divinity called Mephitis, whose grove
and temple were in the Esquiliae, near a place it was thought fatal
to enter. She is thought to have been invoked against the mephitic
exhalations of the earth in the grove of Albunea. Sulphur springs also
were of old regarded as ebullitions from hell, and both Schwarz and
Roger Bacon particularly dealt in that kind of smell. Considering how
largely Asmodeus, as 'fine gentleman,' entered into the composition
of Mephistopheles, and how he flew from Nineveh to Egypt (Tobit)
to avoid a bad smell, it seems the irony of mythology that he should
turn up in Europe as a mephitic spirit.

Mephistopheles is the embodiment of all that has been said in preceding
chapters of the ascetic's horror of nature and the pride of life,
and of the mediaeval priest's curse on all learning he could not
monopolise. The Faust myth is merely his shadow cast on the earth,
the tracery of his terrible power as the Church would have the
people dread it. The early Raven Book at Dresden has the title:--'
      D. J. Fausti       Dreifacher Hollen-Zwung und Magische
(Geister-Commando) nebst den schwarzen Raaben. Romae ad Arcanum
Pontificatus unter Papst Alexander VI. gedruckt. Anno (Christi)
MDI.' In proof of which claim there is a Preface purporting to be
a proclamation signed by the said Pope and Cardinal Piccolomini
concerning the secrets which the celebrated Dr. Faust had scattered
throughout Germany, commanding ut ad Arcanum Pontificatus mandentur et
sicut pupilla oculi in archivio Nostro serventur et custodiantur, atque
extra Valvas Vaticanas non imprimantur neque inde transportentur. Si
vero quiscunque temere contra agere ausus fuerit, Divinam maledictionem
latae sententiae ipso facto servatis Nobis Solis reservandis se
incursurum sciat. Ita mandamus et constituemus Virtute Apostolicae
Ecclesiae Jesu Christi sub poena Excommunicationis ut supra. Anno
secundo Vicariatus Nostri. Romae Verbi incarnati Anno M.D.I.

This is an impudent forgery, but it is an invention which, more than
anything actually issued from Rome, indicates the popular understanding
that the contention of the Church was not against the validity of
magic arts, but against their exercise by persons not authorised
by itself. It was, indeed, a tradition not combated by the priests,
that various ecclesiastics had possessed such powers, even Popes, as
John XXII., Gregory VII., and Clement V. The first Sylvester was said
to have a dragon at his command; John XXII. denounced his physicians
and courtiers for necromancy; and the whispers connecting the Vatican
with sorcery lasted long enough to attribute to the late Pius IX. a
power of the evil eye. Such awful potencies the Church wished to be
ascribed to itself alone. Faust is a legend invented to impress on
the popular mind the fate of all who sought knowledge in unauthorised
ways and for non-ecclesiastical ends.

In the Raven Book just mentioned, there are provisions for calling up
spirits which, in their blending of christian with pagan formulas,
oddly resemble the solemn proceedings sometimes affected by our
spiritual mediums. The magician (Magister) had best be alone, but if
others are present, their number must be odd; he should deliberate
beforehand what business he wishes to transact with the spirits; he
must observe God's commandment; trust the Almighty's help; continue
his conjuration, though the spirits do not appear quickly, with
unwavering faith; mark a circle on parchment with a dove's blood;
within this circle write in Latin the names of the four quarters
of heaven; write around it the Hebrew letters of God's name, and
beneath it write Sadan; and standing in this circle he must repeat
the ninety-first Psalm. In addition there are seals in red and black,
various Hebrew, Greek, and Latin words, chiefly such as contain the
letters Q, W, X, Y, Z,--e.g., Yschyros, Theos, Zebaoth, Adonay. The
specimen (Fig. 22), which I copied from the book in Dresden, is there
called 'Sigillum Telschunhab.' The 'Black Raven' is pictured in the
book, and explained as the form in which the [[angel]] Raphael taught
Tobias to summon spirits. It is said also that the Magician must in
certain cases write with blood of a fish (Tobit again) or bat on
'maiden-parchment,'--this being explained as the skin of a goat,
but unpleasantly suggestive of a different origin.

In this book, poorly printed, and apparently on a private press,
Mephistopheles is mentioned as one of the chief Princes of Hell. He
is described as a youth, adept in all arts and services, who brings
spirit-servants or familiars, and brings treasures from earth and
sea with speed. In the Frankfort Faust Book (1587), Mephistopheles
says, 'I am a spirit, and a flying spirit, potently ruling under
the heavens.' In the oldest legends he appears as a dog, that, as we
have seen, being the normal form of tutelary divinities, the symbol
of the Scribe in Egypt, guard of Hades, and psychopomp of various
mythologies. A dog appears following the family of Tobias. Manlius
reports Melancthon as saying, 'He (Faust) had a dog with him, which
was the Devil.' Johann Gast ('Sermones Conviviales') says he was
present at a dinner at Basle given by Faust, and adds: 'He had also
a dog and a horse with him, both of which, I believe, were devils,
for they were able to do everything. Some persons told me that the
dog frequently took the shape of a servant, and brought him food.' In
the old legends this dog is named Praestigiar. [177]

As for the man Faust, he seems to have been personally the very
figure which the Church required, and had the friar, in whose guise
Mephistopheles appears, been his actual familiar, he could hardly
have done more to bring learning into disgrace. Born at the latter
part of the fifteenth century at Knittlingen, Wurtemberg, of poor
parents, the bequest of an uncle enabled him to study medicine at
Cracow University, and it seems plain that he devoted his learning and
abilities to the work of deluding the public. That he made money by his
'mediumship,' one can only infer from the activity with which he went
about Germany and advertised his 'powers.' It was at a time when high
prices were paid for charms, philtres, mandrake mannikins; and the
witchcraft excitement was not yet advanced enough to render dealing
in such things perilous. It seems that the Catholic clergy made haste
to use this impostor to point their moral against learning, and to
identify him as first-fruit of the Reformation; while the Reformers,
with equal zeal, hurled him back upon the papists as outcome of their
idolatries. Melancthon calls him 'an abominable beast, a sewer of
many devils.' The first mention of him is by Trithemius in a letter
of August 20, 1507, who speaks of him as 'a pretender to magic'
('Magister Georgius Sabellicus, Faustus Junior'), whom he met at
Gelnhaussen; and in another letter of the same year as at Kreuznach,
Conrad Mudt, friend of Luther and Melancthon, mentions (Oct. 3, 1513)
the visit to Erfurth of Georgius Faustus Hemitheus Hedebeyensis, 'a
braggart and a fool who affects magic,' whom he had 'heard talking in
a tavern,' and who had 'raised theologians against him.' In Vogel's
Annals of Leipzig (1714), kept in Auerbach's Cellar, is recorded
under date 1525 Dr. Johann Faust's visit to the Cellar. He appears
therefore to have already had aliases. The first clear account of him
is in the 'Index Sanitatis' of Dr. Philip Begardi (1539), who says:
'Since several years he has gone through all regions, provinces, and
kingdoms, made his name known to everybody, and is highly renowned
for his great skill, not alone in medicine, but also in chiromancy,
necromancy, physiognomy, visions in crystal, and the like other
arts. And also not only renowned, but written down and known as
an experienced master. Himself admitted, nor denied that it was
so, and that his name was Faustus, and called himself philosophum
philosophorum. But how many have complained to me that they were
deceived by him--verily a great number! But what matter?--hin ist hin.'

These latter words may mean that Faust had just died. He must have
died about that time, and with little notice. The rapidity with which
a mythology began to grow around him is worthy of more attention than
the subject has received. In 1543 the protestant theologian Johann
Gast has ('Sermones Convivialium') stories of his diabolical dog and
horse, and of the Devil's taking him off, when his body turns itself
five times face downward. In 1587 Philip Camerarius speaks of him as
'a well-known magician who lived in the time of our fathers.' April
18, 1587, two students of the University of Tubingen were imprisoned
for writing a Comedy of Dr. Faustus: though it was not permitted to
make light of the story, it was thought a very proper one to utilise
for pious purposes, and in the autumn of the same year (1587) the
original form of the legend was published by Spiess in Frankfort. It
describes Faust as summoning the Devil at night, in a forest near
Wittenberg. The evil spirit visits him on three occasions in his
study, where on the third he gives his name as 'Mephostophiles,'
and the compact to serve him for twenty-four years for his soul is
signed. When Faust pierces his hand, the blood flows into the form
of the words O homo fuge! Mephistopheles first serves him as a monk,
and brings him fine garments, wine, and food. Many of the luxuries are
brought from the mansions of prelates, which shows the protestant bias
of the book; which is also shown in the objection the Devil makes to
Faust's marrying, because marriage is pleasing to God. Mephistopheles
changes himself to a winged horse, on which Faust is borne through
many countries, arriving at last at Rome. Faust passes three days,
invisible, in the Vatican, which supplies the author with another
opportunity to display papal luxury, as well as the impotence of
the Pope and his cardinals to exorcise the evil powers which take
their food and goblets when they are about to feast. On his further
aerial voyages Faust gets a glimpse of the garden of Eden; lives in
state in the Sultan's palace in the form of Mohammed; and at length
becomes a favourite in the Court of Charles V. at Innsbruck. Here he
evokes Alexander the Great and his wife. In roaming about Germany,
Faust diverts himself by swallowing a load of hay and horses, cutting
off heads and replacing them, making flowers bloom at Christmas,
drawing wine from a table, and calling Helen of Troy to appear to
some students. Helen becomes his mistress; by her he has a son,
Justus Faustus; but these disappear simultaneously with the dreadful
end of Dr. Faustus, who after a midnight storm is found only in the
fragments with which his room is strewn.

Several of these legends are modifications of those current before
Faust's time. The book had such an immense success that new volumes
and versions on the same subject appeared not only in Germany but
in other parts of Europe,--a rhymed version in England, 1588; a
translation from the German in France, 1589; a Dutch translation,
1592; Christopher Marlowe's drama in 1604.

In Marlowe's 'Tragical History of Doctor Faustus,' the mass of
legends of occult arts that had crystallised around a man thoroughly
representative of them was treated with the dignity due to a subject
amid whose moral and historic grandeur Faust is no longer the petty
personality he really was. He is precisely the character which the
Church had been creating for a thousand years, only suddenly changed
from other-worldly to worldly desires and aims. What he seeks is what
all the energy of civilisation seeks.


        EVIL [[ANGEL]]. Go forward, Faustus, in that famous art
        Wherein all Nature's treasure is contained:
        Be thou on earth as Jove is in the sky,
        Lord and commander of these elements.

        FAUST. How am I glutted with conceit of this!
        Shall I make spirits fetch me what I please,
        Resolve me of all ambiguities,
        Perform what desperate enterprise I will?
        I'll have them fly to India for gold,
        Ransack the ocean for orient pearl,
        And search all corners of the new-found world
        For pleasant fruits and princely delicates;
        I'll have them read me strange philosophy,
        And tell the secrets of all foreign kings;
        I'll have them wall all Germany with brass,
        And make swift Rhine circle fair Wertenberg;
        I'll have them fill the public schools with silk,
        Wherewith the students shall be bravely clad.


For this he is willing to pay his soul, which Theology has so long
declared to be the price of mastering the world.


        This word damnation terrifies not him,
        For he confounds hell in Elysium:
        His ghost be with the old philosophers!


The 'Good [[Angel]]' warns him:


        O Faustus, lay that damned book aside,
        And gaze not on it, lest it tempt thy soul,
        And heap God's heavy wrath upon thy head!
        Read, read the Scriptures:--that is blasphemy.


So, dying away amid the thunders of the Reformation, were heard the
echoes of the early christian voices which exulted in the eternal
tortures of the Greek poets and philosophers: the anathemas on Roger
Bacon, Socinus, Galileo; the outcries with which every great invention
has been met. We need only retouch the above extracts here and there
to make Faust's aspirations those of a saint. Let the gold be sought
in New Jerusalem, the pearl in its gates, the fruits in paradise,
the philosophy that of Athanasius, and no amount of selfish hunger
and thirst for them would grieve any 'Good [[Angel]]' he had ever heard of.

The 'Good [[Angel]]' has not yet gained his wings who will tell him that
all he seeks is included in the task of humanity, but warn him that
the method by which he would gain it is just that by which he has
been instructed to seek gold and jasper of the New Jerusalem,--not
by fulfilling the conditions of them, but as the object of some
favouritism. Every human being who ever sought to obtain benefit
by prayers or praises that might win the good graces of a supposed
bestower of benefits, instead of by working for them, is but the Faust
of his side--be it supernal or infernal. Hocus-pocus and invocation,
blood-compacts and sacraments,--they are all the same in origin;
they are all mean attempts to obtain advantages beyond other people
without serving up to them or deserving them. To Beelzebub Faust will
'build an altar and a church;' but he had probably never entered a
church or knelt before an altar with any less selfishness.

A strong Nemesis follows Self to see that its bounds are not overpassed
without retribution. Its satisfactions must be weighed in the balance
with its renunciations. And the inflexible law applies to intellect and
self-culture as much as to any other power of man. Mephistopheles is
'the kernel of the brute;' he is the intellect with mere canine hunger
for knowledge because of the power it brings. Or, falling on another
part of human nature, it is pride making itself abject for ostentation;
or it is passion selling love for lust. Re-enter Mephistopheles with
Devils, who give crowns and rich apparel to Faustus, dance, and then
depart. To the man who has received his intellectual and moral liberty
only to so spend it, Lucifer may well say, in Marlowe's words--


        Christ cannot save thy soul, for he is just:
        There's none but I have interest in the same.


Perhaps he might even better have suggested to Faust that his soul
was not of sufficient significance to warrant much anxiety.

Something was gained when it was brought before the people in popular
dramas of Faust how little the Devil cared for the cross which had so
long been regarded as the all-sufficient weapon against him. [178]
Faust and Mephistopheles flourish in the Vatican despite all the
crosses raised to exorcise them. The confession of the cross which
once meant martyrdom of the confessor had now come to mean martyrdom
of the denier. Protestantism put its faith in Theology, Creeds, and
Orthodoxy. But Calderon de la Barca blended the legend of Faust with
the legendary temptation of St. Cyprian, and in 'El Magico Prodigioso'
we have, in impressive contrast, the powerlessness of the evil powers
over the heart of a pure woman, and its easy entrance into a mind fully
furnished with the soundest sentiments of theology. St. Cyprian had
been a worshipper of pagan deities [179] before his conversion, and
even after this he had once saved himself while other christians were
suffering martyrdom. It is possible that out of this may have grown the
legend of his having called his earlier deities--theoretically changed
to devils--to his aid; a trace of the legend being that magical 'Book
of Cyprianus' mentioned in another chapter. In his tract 'De Gratia
Dei' Cyprian says concerning his spiritual condition before conversion,
'I lay in darkness, and floating on the world's boisterous sea,
with no resting-place for my feet, ignorant of my proper life, and
estranged from truth and light.' Here is a metaphorical 'vasty deep'
from which the centuries could hardly fail to conjure up spirits,
one of them being the devil of Calderon's drama, who from a wrecked
ship walks Christ-like over the boisterous sea to find Cyprian on
the sea-shore. The drama opens with a scene which recalls the most
perilous of St. Anthony's temptations. According to Athanasius, the
Devil having utterly failed to conquer Anthony's virtue by charming
images, came to him in his proper black and ugly shape, and, candidly
confessing that he was the Devil, said he had been vanquished by
the saint's extraordinary sanctity. Anthony prevailed against the
spirit of pride thus awakened; but Calderon's Cyprian, though he
does not similarly recognise the Devil, becomes complacent at the
dialectical victory which the tempter concedes him. Cyprian having
argued the existence and supremacy of God, the Devil says, 'How can
I impugn so clear a consequence?' 'Do you regret my victory?' 'Who
but regrets a check in rivalry of wit?' He leaves, and Cyprian says,
'I never met a more learned person.' The Devil is equally satisfied,
knowing, no doubt, that gods worked out by the wits alone remain in
their abode of abstraction and do not interfere with the world of
sense. Calderon is artful enough to throw the trial of Cyprian back
into his pagan period, but the mirror is no less true in reflecting
for those who had eyes to see in it the weakness of theology.

'Enter the Devil as a fine gentleman,' is the first sign of the
temptation in Calderon's drama--it is Asmodeus [180] again, and the
'pride of life' he first brings is the conceit of a clever theological
victory. So sufficient is the doorway so made for all other pride
to enter, that next time the devil needs no disguise, but has only
to offer him a painless victory over nature and the world, including
Justina, the object of his passion.


                  Wouldst thou that I work
        A charm over this waste and savage wood,
        This Babylon of crags and aged trees,
        Filling its coverts with a horror
        Thrilling and strange?...
                  I offer thee the fruit
        Of years of toil in recompense; whate'er
        Thy wildest dream presented to thy thought
        As object of desire, shall be thine. [181]


Justina knows less about the philosophical god of Cyprian, and more
of the might of a chaste heart. To the Devil she says--


        Thought is not in my power, but action is:
        I will not move my foot to follow thee.


The Devil is compelled to say at last--


        Woman, thou hast subdued me,
        Only by not owning thyself subdued.


He is only able to bring a counterfeit of Justina to her lover.

Like Goethe's Mephistopheles, Cyprian's devil is unable to perform
his exact engagements, and consequently does not win in the game. He
enables Cyprian to move mountains and conquer beasts, until he boasts
that he can excel his infernal teacher, but the Devil cannot bring
Justina. She has told Cyprian that she will love him in death. Cyprian
and she together abjure their paganism at Antioch, and meet in a
cell just before their martyrdom. Over their bodies lying dead on
the scaffold the Devil appears as a winged serpent, and says he is
compelled to announce that they have both ascended to heaven. He
descends into the earth.

What the story of Faust and Mephistopheles had become in the popular
mind of Germany, when Goethe was raising it to be an immortal type of
the conditions under which genius and art can alone fulfil their task,
is well shown in the sensational tragedy written by his contemporary,
the playwright Klinger. The following extract from Klinger's 'Faust'
is not without a certain impressiveness.

'Night covered the earth with its raven wing. Faust stood before
the awful spectacle of the body of his son suspended upon the
gallows. Madness parched his brain, and he exclaimed in the wild
tones of dispair:

'Satan, let me but bury this unfortunate being, and then you may take
this life of mine, and I will descend into your infernal abode, where
I shall no more behold men in the flesh. I have learned to know them,
and I am disgusted with them, with their destiny, with the world,
and with life. My good action has drawn down unutterable woe upon my
head; I hope that my evil ones may have been productive of good. Thus
should it be in the mad confusion of earth. Take me hence; I wish
to become an inhabitant of thy dreary abode; I am tired of light,
compared with which the darkness in the infernal regions must be the
brightness of mid-day.'

But Satan replied: 'Hold! not so fast--Faust; once I told thee that
thou alone shouldst be the arbiter of thy life, that thou alone
shouldst have power to break the hour-glass of thy existence; thou
hast done so, and the hour of my vengeance has come, the hour for
which I have sighed so long. Here now do I tear from thee thy mighty
wizard-wand, and chain thee within the narrow bounds which I draw
around thee. Here shalt thou stand and listen to me, and tremble;
I will draw forth the terrors of the dark past, and kill thee with
slow despair.

'Thus will I exult over thee, and rejoice in my victory. Fool! thou
hast said that thou hast learned to know man! Where? How and when? Hast
thou ever considered his nature? Hast thou ever examined it, and
separated from it its foreign elements? Hast thou distinguished
between that which is offspring of the pure impulses of his heart,
and that which flows from an imagination corrupted by art? Hast thou
compared the wants and the vices of his nature with those which he
owes to society and prevailing corruption? Hast thou observed him in
his natural state, where each of his undisguised expressions mirrors
forth his inmost soul? No--thou hast looked upon the mask that society
wears, and hast mistaken it for the true lineaments of man; thou hast
only become acquainted with men who have consecrated their condition,
wealth, power, and talents to the service of corruption; who have
sacrificed their pure nature to your Idol--Illusion. Thou didst at
one time presume to show me the moral worth of man! and how didst
thou set about it! By leading me upon the broad highways of vice,
by bringing me to the courts of the mighty wholesale butchers of men,
to that of the coward tyrant of France, of the Usurper in England! Why
did we pass by the mansions of the good and the just? Was it for me,
Satan, to whom thou hast chosen to become a mentor, to point them out
to thee? No; thou wert led to the places thou didst haunt by the fame
of princes, by thy pride, by thy longing after dissipation. And what
hast thou seen there? The soul-seared tyrants of mankind, with their
satellites, wicked women and mercenary priests, who make religion a
tool by which to gain the object of their base passions.

'Hast thou ever deigned to cast a glance at the oppressed, who, sighing
under his burden, consoles himself with the hope of an hereafter? Hast
thou ever sought for the dwelling of the virtuous friend of humanity,
for that of the noble sage, for that of the active and upright father
of a family?

'But how would that have been possible? How couldst thou, the most
corrupt of thy race, have discovered the pure one, since thou hadst
not even the capacity to suspect his existence?

'Proudly didst thou pass by the cottages of the pure and humble,
who live unacquainted with even the names of your artificial vices,
who earn their bread in the sweat of their brow, and who rejoice at
their last hour that they are permitted to exchange the mortal for the
immortal. It is true, hadst thou entered their abode, thou mightst
not have found thy foolish ideal of an heroic, extravagant virtue,
which is only the fanciful creation of your vices and your pride;
but thou wouldst have seen the man of a retiring modesty and noble
resignation, who in his obscurity excels in virtue and true grandeur
of soul your boasted heroes of field and cabinet. Thou sayest that
thou knowest man! Dost thou know thyself? Nay, deeper yet will I
enter into the secret places of thy heart, and fan with fierce blast
the flames which thou hast kindled there for thee.

'Had I a thousand human tongues, and as many years to speak to thee,
they would be all insufficient to develop the consequences of thy
deeds and thy recklessness. The germ of wretchedness which thou
hast sown will continue its growth through centuries yet to come;
and future generations will curse thee as the author of their misery.

'Behold, then, daring and reckless man, the importance of actions
that appear circumscribed to your mole vision! Who of you can say,
Time will obliterate the trace of my existence! Thou who knowest not
what beginning, what middle, and end are, hast dared to seize with
a bold hand the chain of fate, and hast attempted to gnaw its links,
notwithstanding that they were forged for eternity!

'But now will I withdraw the veil from before thy eyes, and then--cast
the spectre despair into thy soul.'

'Faust pressed his hands upon his face; the worm that never dieth
gnawed already on his heart.'

The essence and sum of every devil are in the Mephistopheles of
Goethe. He is culture.


        Culture, which smooth the whole world licks,
        Also unto the Devil sticks.


He represents the intelligence which has learned the difference
between ideas and words, knows that two and two make four, and also how
convenient may be the dexterity that can neatly write them out five.


        Of Metaphysics learn the use and beauty!
        See that you most profoundly gain
        What does not suit the human brain!
        A splendid word to serve, you'll find
        For what goes in--or won't go in--your mind.

        On words let your attention centre!
        Then through the safest gate you'll enter
        The temple halls of certainty. [182]


He knows, too, that the existing moment alone is of any advantage;
that theory is grey and life ever green; that he only gathers real
fruit who confides in himself. He is thus the perfectly evolved
intellect of man, fully in possession of all its implements, these
polished till they shine in all grace, subtlety, adequacy. Nature
shows no symbol of such power more complete than the gemmed serpent
with its exquisite adaptations,--freed from cumbersome prosaic feet,
equal to the winged by its flexible spine, every tooth artistic.

From an ancient prison was this Ariel liberated by his Prospero,
whose wand was the Reformation, a spirit finely touched to fine
issues. But his wings cannot fly beyond the atmosphere. The ancient
heaven has faded before the clearer eye, but the starry ideals have
come nearer. The old hells have burnt out, but the animalism of man
couches all the more freely on his path, having broken every chain of
fear. Man still walks between the good and evil, on the hair-drawn
bridge of his moral nature. His faculties seem adapted with equal
precision to either side of his life, upper or under,--to Wisdom
or Cunning, Self-respect or Self-conceit, Prudence or Selfishness,
Lust or Love.

Such is the seeming situation, but is it the reality? Goethe's 'Faust'
is the one clear answer which this question has received.

In one sense Mephistopheles may be called a German devil. The
Christian soul of Germany was from the first a changeling. The ancient
Nature-worship of that race might have had its normal development in
the sciences, and alone with this intellectual evolution there must
have been formed a related religion able to preserve social order
through the honour of man. But the native soul of Germany was cut
out by the sword and replaced with a mongrel Hebrew-Latin soul. The
metaphorical terrors of tropical countries,--the deadly worms, the
burning and suffocating blasts and stenches, with which the mind of
those dwelling near them could familiarise itself when met with in
their scriptures, acquired exaggerated horrors when left to be pictured
by the terrorised imagination of races ignorant of their origin. It
is a long distance from Potsdam and Hyde Park to Zahara. Christianity
therefore blighted nature in the north by apparitions more fearful
than the southern world ever knew, and long after the pious there
could sing and dance, puritanical glooms hung over the Christians
of higher latitudes. When the progress of German culture began the
work of dissipating these idle terrors, the severity of the reaction
was proportioned to the intensity of the delusions. The long-famished
faculties rushed almost madly into their beautiful world, but without
the old reverence which had once knelt before its phenomena. That may
remain with a few, but the cynicism of the noisiest will be reflected
even upon the faces of the best. Goethe first had his attention drawn
to Spinoza by a portrait of him on a tract, in which his really noble
countenance was represented with a diabolical aspect. The orthodox had
made it, but they could only have done so by the careers of Faust,
Paracelsus, and their tribe. These too helped to conventionalise
Voltaire into a Mephistopheles. [183]

Goethe was probably the first European man to carry out this scepticism
to its full results. He was the first who recognised that the moral
edifice based upon monastic theories must follow them; and he had in
his own life already questioned the right of the so-called morality to
its supreme if not tyrannous authority over man. Hereditary conscience,
passing through this fierce crucible, lay levigable before Goethe, to
be swept away into dust-hole or moulded into the image of reason. There
remained around the animal nature of a free man only a thread which
seemed as fine as that which held the monster Fenris. It was made
only of the sentiment of love and that of honour. But as Fenris
found the soft invisible thread stronger than chains, Faust proved
the tremendous sanctions that surround the finer instincts of man.

Emancipated from grey theory, Faust rushes hungrily at the golden
fruit of life. The starved passions will have their satisfaction,
at whatever cost to poor Gretchen. The fruit turns to ashes on
his lips. The pleasure is not that of the thinking man, but of the
accomplished poodle he has taken for his guide. To no moment in that
intrigue can the suffrage of his whole nature say, 'Stay, thou art
fair!' That is the pact--it is the distinctive keynote of Goethe's
'Faust.'


        Canst thou by falsehood or by flattery
        Make me one moment with myself at peace,
        Cheat me into tranquillity?--come then
        And welcome life's last day.
        Make me to the passing moment plead.
        Fly not, O stay, thou art so fair!
        Then will I gladly perish.


The pomp and power of the court, luxury and wealth, equally fail
to make the scholar at peace with himself. They are symbolised in
the paper money by which Mephistopheles replenished the imperial
exchequer. The only allusion to the printing-press, whose inventor
Fust had been somewhat associated with Faust, is to show its power
turned to the work of distributing irredeemable promises.

At length one demand made by Faust makes Mephistopheles tremble. As a
mere court amusement he would have him raise Helen of Troy. Reluctant
that Faust should look upon the type of man's harmonious development,
yet bound to obey, Mephistopheles sends him to the Mothers,--the
healthy primal instincts and ideals of man which expressed themselves
in the fair forms of art. Corrupted by superstition of their own
worshippers, cursed by christianity, they 'have a Hades of their own,'
as Mephistopheles says, and he is unwilling to interfere with them. The
image appears, and the sense of Beauty is awakened in Faust. But he
is still a christian as to his method: his idea is that heaven must
be taken by storm, by chance, wish, prayer, any means except patient
fulfilment of the conditions by which it may be reached. Helen is
flower of the history and culture of Greece; and so lightly Faust
would pluck and wear it!

Helen having vanished as he tried to clasp her, Faust has learned
his second lesson. When he next meets Helen it is not to seek
intellectual beauty as, in Gretchen's case, he had sought the sensuous
and sensual. He has fallen under a charm higher than that of either
Church or Mephistopheles; the divorce of ages between flesh and spirit,
the master-crime of superstition, from which all devils sprang, was
over for him from the moment that he sees the soul embodied and body
ensouled in the art-ideal of Greece.

The redemption of Faust through Art is the gospel of the nineteenth
century. This is her vesture which Helen leaves him when she vanishes,
and which bears him as a cloud to the land he is to make beautiful. The
purest Art--Greek Art--is an expression of Humanity: it can as little
be turned to satisfy a self-culture unhumanised as to consist with a
superstition which insults nature. When Faust can meet with Helen,
and part without any more clutching, he is not hurled back to his
Gothic study and mocking devil any more: he is borne away until he
reaches the land where his thought and work are needed. Blindness
falls on him--or what Theology deems such: for it is metaphorical--it
means that he has descended from clouds to the world, and the actual
earth has eclipsed a possible immortality.


        The sphere of Earth is known enough to me;
        The view beyond is barred immortality:
        A fool who there his blinking eyes directeth,
        And o'er his clouds of peers a place expecteth!
        Firm let him stand and look around him well!
        This World means something to the capable;
        Why needs he through Eternity to wend?


The eye for a fictitious world lost, leaves the vision for reality
clearer. In every hard chaotic object Faust can now detect a slumbering
beauty. The swamps and pools of the unrestrained sea, the oppressed
people, the barrenness and the flood, they are all paths to Helen--a
nobler Helen than Greece knew. When he has changed one scene of
Chaos into Order, and sees a free people tilling the happy earth,
then, indeed, he has realised the travail of his manhood, and
is satisfied. To a moment which Mephistopheles never brought him,
he cries 'Stay, thou art fair!'

Mephistopheles now, as becomes a creation of the Theology of obtaining
what is not earned, calls up infernal troops to seize Faust's soul,
but the angels pelt them with roses. The roses sting them worse than
flames. The roses which Faust has evoked from briars are his defence:
they are symbols of man completing his nature by a self-culture
which finds its satisfaction in making some outward desert rejoice
and blossom like the rose.

The most important remnant of the [[Odin]] myth is the universal legend of
the Wild Huntsman. The following variants are given by Wuttke. [184]
In Central and South Germany the Wild Hunt is commonly called
Wutenden Heere, i.e., Wodan's army or chase--called in the Middle
Ages, Wuotanges Heer. The hunter, generally supposed to be abroad
during the twelve nights after Christmas, is variously called Wand,
Waul, Wodejager, Helljager, Nightjager, Hackelberg, Hackelberend
(man in armour), Fro Gode, Banditterich, Jenner. The most common
belief is that he is the spectre of a wicked lord or king who
sacrilegiously enjoyed the chase on Sundays and other holy days,
and who is condemned to expiate his sin by hunting till the day of
doom. He wears a broad-brimmed hat; is followed by dogs and other
animals, fiery, and often three-legged; and in his spectral train
are the souls of unbaptized children, huntsmen who have trodden down
grain, witches, and others--these being mounted on horses, goats,
and cocks, and sometimes headless, or with their entrails dragging
behind them. They rush with a fearful noise through the air, which
resounds with the cracking of whips, neighing of horses, barking of
dogs, and cries of ghostly huntsmen. The unlucky wight encountered
is caught up into the air, where his neck is wrung, or he is dropped
from a great height. In some regions, it is said, such must hunt until
relieved, but are not slain. The huntsman is a Nemesis on poachers or
trespassers in woods and forests. Sometimes the spectres have combats
with each other over battlefields. Their track is marked with bits
of horseflesh, human corpses, legs with shoes on. In some regions,
it is said, the huntsmen carry battle-axes, and cut down all who
come in their way. When the hunt is passing all dogs on earth become
still and quiet. In most regions there is some haunted gorge, hill,
or castle in which the train disappears.

In Thuringia, it is said that, when the fearful noises of the spectral
hunt come very near, they change to ravishing music. In the same
euphemistic spirit some of the prognostications it brings are not evil:
generally, indeed, the apparition portends war, pestilence, and famine,
but frequently it announces a fruitful year. If, in passing a house,
one of the train dips his finger in the yeast, the staff of life will
never be wanting in that house. Whoever sees the chase will live long,
say the Bohemians; but he must not hail it, lest flesh and bones rain
upon him.

In most regions, however, there is thought to be great danger in
proximity to the hunt. The perils are guarded against by prostration on
the earth face downward, praying meanwhile; by standing on a white
cloth (Bertha's linen), or wrapping the same around the head; by
putting the head between the spokes of a wheel; by placing palm leaves
on a table. The hunt may be observed securely from the cross-roads,
which it shuns, or by standing on a stump marked with three crosses--as
is often done by woodcutters in South Germany.

Wodan also appears in the Schimmelreiter--headless rider on a white
horse, in Swabia called Bachreiter or Junker Jakele. This apparition
sometimes drives a carriage drawn by four white (or black) horses,
usually headless. He is the terrible forest spectre Hoimann, a giant
in broad-brimmed hat, with moss and lichen for beard; he rides a
headless white horse through the air, and his wailing cry, 'Hoi,
hoi!' means that his reign is ended. He is the bugbear of children.

In the Odinwald are the Riesenaule and Riesenaltar, with mystic marks
declaring them relics of a temple of [[Odin]]. Near Erbach is Castle
Rodenstein, the very fortress of the Wild Jager, to which he passes
with his horrid train from the ruins of Schnellert. The village of
Reichelsheim has on file the affidavits of the people who heard him
just before the battles of Leipzig and Waterloo. Their theory is
that if the Jager returns swiftly to Schnellert all will go well for
Germany; but if he tarry at Rodenstein 'tis an omen of evil. He was
reported near Frankfort in 1832; but it is notable that no mention
of him was made during the late Franco-German war.

A somewhat later and rationalised variant relates that the wild
huntsman was Hackelberg, the Lord of Rodenstein, whose tomb--really
a Druidical stone--is shown at the castle, and said to be guarded
by hell-hounds. Hackelberg is of old his Brunswick name. It was the
Hackelberg Hill that opened to receive the children, which the Pied
Piper of Hamelin charmed away with his flute from that old town,
because the corporation would not pay him what they had promised
for ridding them of rats. It is easy to trace this Pied Piper,
who has become so familiar through Mr. Robert Browning's charming
poem, to the [[Odin]] of more blessed memory, who says in the Havamal,
'I know a song by which I soften and enchant my enemies, and render
their weapons of no effect.'

This latter aspect of [[Odin]], his command over vermin, connects him
with the Slavonic Lyeshy, or forest-demon of the Russias. The ancient
thunder-god of Russia, Perun, who rides in his storm-chariot through
the sky, has in the more christianised districts dropped his mantle
on Ilya (Elias); while in the greater number of Slavonic districts he
has held his original physical characters so remarkably that it has
been necessary to include him among demons. In Slavonian Folklore the
familiar myth of the wild huntsman is distributed--Vladimir the Great
fulfils one part of it by still holding high revel in the halls of
Kief, but he is no huntsman; Perun courses noisily through the air, but
he is rather benevolent than otherwise; the diabolical characteristics
of the superstition have fallen to the evil huntsmen (Lyeshies),
who keep the wild creatures as their flocks, the same as shepherds
their herds, and whom every huntsman must propitiate. The Lyeshy is
gigantic, wears a sheepskin, has one eye without eyebrow or eyelash,
horns, feet of a goat, is covered with green hair, and his finger-nails
are claws. He is special protector of the bears and wolves.

In Denmark the same myth appears as King Volmer's Hunt. Waldemar was
so passionately fond of the chase that he said if the Lord would only
let him hunt for ever near Gurre (his castle in the north of Seeland),
he would not envy him his paradise. For this blasphemous wish he is
condemned to hunt between Burre and Gurre for ever. His cavalcade is
much like that already described. Volmer rides a snow-white charger,
preceded by a pack of coal-black hounds, and he carries his head
under his left arm. On St. John the women open gates for him. It
is believed that he is allowed brief repose at one and another of
his old seats, and it is said spectral servants are sometimes seen
preparing the ruined castle at Vordingborg for him, or at Waldemar's
Tower. A sceptical peasant resolved to pass the night in this tower. At
midnight the King entered, and, thanking him for looking after his
tower, gave him a gold piece which burned through his hand and fell
to the ground as a coal. On the other hand, Waldemar sometimes makes
peasants hold his dogs, and afterwards throws them coals which turn
out to be gold pieces.

The Palnatoke or Palne Hunter appears mostly in the island of
Fuen. Every New Year's night he supplies himself with three horse-shoes
from some smithy, and the smith takes care that he may find them
ready for use on his anvil, as he always leaves three gold pieces in
their stead. If the shoes are not ready for him, he carries the anvil
off. In one instance he left an anvil on the top of a church tower,
and it caused the smith great trouble to get it down again.

King Abel was interred after his death in St. Peter's Church in
Sleswig, but the fratricide could find no peace in his grave. His
ghost walked about in the night and disturbed the monks in their
devotions. The body was finally removed from the church, and
sunk in a foul bog near Gottorp. To keep him down effectively, a
pointed stake was drove through his body. The spot is still called
Konigsgrabe. Notwithstanding this, he appears seated on a coal-black
charger, followed by a pack of black hounds with eyes and tongues of
fire. The gates are heard slamming and opening, and the shrieks and
yells are such that they appal the stoutest hearts.

At the ancient capital of Fuen, Odense, said to have been built
by [[Odin]], the myth has been reduced to a spectral Christmas-night
equipage, which issues from St. Canute's Church and passes to the
ancient manor-house of Glorup. It is a splendid carriage, drawn by
six black horses with fiery tongues, and in it are seated the Lords
of Glorup, famous for their cruelty to peasants, and now not able to
rest in the church where they were interred. It is of evil omen to
witness the spectacle: a man who watched for it was struck blind.

In France Le Grand Veneur bears various names; he is King Arthur,
Saint Hubert, Hugo. His alleged appearances within historic times
have been so strongly attested that various attempts have been made
to give them rational explanations. Thus Charles VI. of France,
when going to war in Bretagne, is said to have been met by such a
spectre in the Forest of Mans, and became insane; he believed himself
to have been the victim of sorcery, as did many of his subjects. It
has been said that the King was met by a disguised emissary of the
Duc de Bretagne. More particular accounts are given of the apparition
of the Wild Huntsman to Henry IV. when he was hunting with the Comte
de Soissons in the Forest of Fontainebleau, an event commemorated by
'La Croix du Grand Veneur.' According to Matthieu, [185] both the King
and the Count heard the cries of the hunt, and when the Count went to
discover their origin, the terrible dark figure stood forth and cried,
'You wish to see me, then behold!' This incident has been explained
variously, as a project of assassination, or as the jest of two fellows
who, in 1596, were amusing Paris by their skill in imitating all
the sounds of a hunt. But such phantoms had too long hunted through
the imagination of the French peasantry for any explanation to be
required. Robert le Diable, wandering in Normandy till judgment-day,
and King Arthur, at an early date domesticated in France as a spectral
huntsman (the figure most popularly identified at the time with the
phantom seen by Henry IV.), are sufficient explanations. The ruins of
Arthur's Castle near Huelgoat, Finistere, were long believed to hide
enormous treasures, guarded by demons, who appear sometimes as fiery
lights (ignes fatuui), owls, buzzards, and ravens--one of the latter
being the form in which Arthur comes from his happy Vale of Avallon,
when he would vary its repose with a hunt. [186]

A sufficiently curious interchange of such superstitions is represented
in the following extract from Surtees:--'Sir Anthon Bek, busshop of
Dureme in the tyme of King Eduarde, the son of King Henry, was the
maist prowd and masterfull busshop in all England, and it was com'only
said that he was the prowdest lord of Christienty. It chaunced that
emong other lewd persons, this sir Anthon entertained at his court
one Hugh de Pountchardon, that for his evill deeds and manifold
robberies had been driven out of the Inglische courte, and had come
from the southe to seek a little bread, and to live by staylinge. And
to this Hughe, whom also he imployed to good purpose in the warr of
Scotland, the busshop gave the land of Thikley, since of him called
Thikley-Puntchardon, and also made him his chiefe huntsman. And after,
this blake Hughe died afore the busshop; and efter that the busshop
chasid the wild hart in Galtres forest, and sodainly ther met with
him Hugh de Pontchardon, that was afore deid, on a wythe horse; and
the said Hughe loked earnestly on the busshop, and the busshop said
unto him, 'Hughe, what makethe thee here?' and he spake never word,
but lifte up his cloke, and then he showed sir Anton his ribbes set
with bones, and nothing more; and none other of the varlets saw him
but the busshop only; and ye said Hughe went his way, and sir Anton
toke corage, and cheered the dogges; and shortly efter he was made
Patriarque of Hierusalem, and he same nothing no moe; and this Hugh
is him that the silly people in Galtres doe call le Gros Veneur,
and he was seen twice efter that by simple folk, afore yat the forest
was felled in the tyme of Henry, father of King Henry yat now ys.'

Upon this uncanny fellow fell the spectral mantle of Hugo
Capet; elsewhere as is probable, worn by nocturnal protestant
assemblies--Huguenots.

The legend of the Wild Huntsman tinges many old English stories. Herne,
the Hunter, may be identified with him, and the demons, with ghostly
and headless wish-hounds, who still hunt evil-doers over Dartmoor on
stormy nights, are his relations. The withered look of horses grazing
on Penzance Common was once explained by their being ridden by demons,
and the fire-breathing horse has found its way by many weird routes
to the service of the Exciseman in the 'Ingoldsby Legends,' or that
of Earl Garrett, who rides round the Curragh of Kildare on a steed
whose inch-thick silver shoes must wear as thin as a cat's ear,
ere he fights the English and reigns over Ireland. The Teutonic myth
appears very plainly in the story of Tregeagle. This man, traced to
an old Cornish family, is said to have been one of the wickedest men
that ever lived; but though he had disposed of his soul to the Devil,
the evil one was baulked by the potency of St. Petroc. This, however,
was on condition of Tregeagle's labouring at the impossible task of
clearing the sand from Porthcurnow Cove, at which work he may still
be heard groaning when wind and wave are high. Whenever he tries
to snatch a moment's rest, the demon is at liberty to pursue him,
and they may be heard on stormy nights in hot pursuit of the poor
creature, whose bull-like roar passed into the Cornish proverb,
'to roar like Tregeagle.'

On a pleasant Sunday evening in July 1868, I witnessed 'Der Freischutz'
in the newly-opened opera-house at Leipzig. Never elsewhere have I seen
such completeness and splendour in the weird effects of the infernal
scene in the Wolf's Glen. The 'White Lady' started forth at every step
of Rodolph's descent to the glen, warning him back. Zamiel, instead
of the fiery garb he once wore as Samael, was arrayed in raiment
black as night; and when the magic bullet was moulded, the stage
swarmed with huge reptiles, fiery serpents crawled on the ground,
a dragon-drawn chariot, with wheels of fire, driven by a skeleton,
passed through the air; and the wild huntsman's chase, composed of
animals real to the eye and uttering their distinguishable cries,
hurried past. The animals represented were the horse, hound, boar,
stag, chamois, raven, bat, owl, and they rushed amid the wild blast
of horns.

I could but marvel at the yet more strange and weird history of the
human imagination through which had flitted, from the varied regions
of a primitive world, the shapes combined in this apotheosis of
diablerie. Probably if Elijah in his fire-chariot, preached about
in the neighbouring church that morning, and this wild huntsman
careering in the opera, had looked closely at each other and at their
own history, they might have found a common ancestor in the mythical
Mahan Bali of India, the king whose austerities raised in power till
he excited the jealousy of the gods, until Vishnu crushed him with his
heel into the infernal regions, where he still exercises sovereignty,
and is permitted to issue forth for an annual career (at the Onam
festival), as described in Southey's 'Curse of Kehama.' And they
might probably both claim mythological relationship with Yami, lord of
death, who, as Jami, began in Persia the career of all warriors that
never died, but sometimes sleep till a magic horn shall awaken them,
sometimes dwell, like Jami himself and King Arthur, in happy isles,
and in other cases issue forth at certain periods for the chase or
for war--like [[Odin]] and Waldemar--with an infernal train.

But how did these mighty princes and warriors become demon huntsmen?

In the Persian 'Desatir' it is related that the animals contested
the superiority of man, the two orders of beings being represented by
their respective sages, and the last animal to speak opposed the claim
of his opponent that man attained elevation to the nature of angels,
with the remark, 'In his putting to death of animals and similar acts
man resembleth the beasts of prey, and not angels.'

The prophet of the world then said, 'We deem it sinful to kill
harmless, but right to slay ravenous, animals. Were all ravenous
animals to enter into a compact not to kill harmless animals, we
would abstain from slaying them, and hold them dear as ourselves.'

Upon this the wolf made a treaty with the ram, and the lion became
friend of the stag. No tyranny was left in the world, till man (Dehak)
broke the treaty and began to kill animals. In consequence of this,
none observed the treaty except the harmless animals. [187]

This fable, from the Aryan side, may be regarded as showing the
reason of the evil repute which gathered around the name of Dehak
or Zohak. The eating of animal food was among our Aryan ancestors
probably the provisional commissariat of a people migrating from
their original habitat. The animals slain for food had all their
original consecration, and even the ferocious were largely invested
with awe. The woodcutters of Bengal invoke Kalrayu--an archer
tiger-mounted--to protect them against the wild beasts he (a form of
Siva) is supposed to exterminate; but while the exterminator of the
most dangerous animals may, albeit without warrant in the Shastr,
be respected in India, the huntsman is generally of evil repute. The
gentle Krishna was said to have been slain by an arrow from the bow
of Ungudu, a huntsman, who left the body to rot under a tree where
it fell, the bones being the sacred relics for which the image of
Jugernath at Orissa was constructed. [188]

It is not known at what period the notion of transmigration arose,
but that must have made him appear cannibalistic who first hunted
and devoured animals. Such was the Persian Zohak (or Dehak). His
Babylonian form, Nimrod, represented also the character of Esau,
as huntsman; that is, the primitive enemy of the farmer, and of the
commerce in grains; the preserver of wildness, and consequently of
all those primitive aboriginal idolatries which linger in the heaths
(whence heathen) and country villages (whence pagans) long after
they have passed away from the centres of civilisation. Hunting is
essentially barbarous. The willingness of some huntsmen even now,
when this serious occupation of an early period has become a sport,
to sacrifice not only animal life to their pleasure, but also the
interests of labour and agriculture, renders it very easy for us to
understand the transformation of Nimrod into a demon. In the Hebrew
and Arabian legends concerning Nimrod, that 'mighty hunter' is shown
as related to the wild elements and their worshipper. When Abraham,
having broken the images of his father, was brought by Terah before
Nimrod, the King said, 'Let us worship the fire!'

'Rather the water that quenches the fire,' said Abraham.

'Well, the water.'

'Rather the cloud that carries the water.'

'Well, the cloud.'

'Rather the wind that scatters the cloud.'

'Well, the wind.'

'Rather man, for he withstands the wind.'

'Thou art a babbler,' said Nimrod. 'I worship the fire and will cast
thee into it.'

When Abraham was cast into the fiery furnace by Nimrod, and on the
seventh day after was found sitting amid the roses of a garden,
the mighty hunter--hater of gardens--resolved on a daring hunt for
Abraham's God himself. He built a tower five thousand cubits high, but
finding heaven still far away, he attached a car to two half-starved
eagles, and by holding meat above them they flew upward, until Nimrod
heard a voice saying, 'Godless man, whither goest thou?' The audacious
man shot an arrow in the direction of the voice; the arrow returned
to him stained with blood, and Nimrod believed that he had wounded
Abraham's God.

He who hunted the universe was destroyed by one of the weakest of
animated beings--a fly. In the aspiring fly which attacked Nimrod's
lip, and then nose, and finally devoured his brain, the Moslem and
Hebrew doctors saw the fittest end of one whose adventurous spirit
had not stopped to attack animals, man, Abraham, and Allah himself.

But though, in one sense, destroyed, Nimrod, say various myths, may
be heard tumbling and groaning about the base of his tower of Babel,
where the confusion of tongues took place; and it might be added,
that they have, like the groan, a meaning irrespective of race or
language. Dehak and Nimrod have had their brothers in every race, which
has ever reached anything that may be called civilisation. It was the
barbaric Baron and the Robber Knight of the Middle Ages, living by
the hunt, who, before conversion, made for the Faithful Eckhardts of
the Church the chief impediment; they might then strike down the monk,
whose apparition has always been the legendary warning of the Demon's
approach. When the Eckhardts had baptized these knights, they had
already been transformed to the Devils which people the forests of
Germany, France, and England with their terrible spectres. The wild
fables of the East, telling of fell Demons coursing through the air,
whispered to the people at one ear, and the equally wild deeds of the
Robber Knights at the other. The Church had given the people one name
for all such phantasms--Devil--and it was a name representative of
the feelings of both priest and peasant, so long as the Robber Knights
were their common enemy. Jesus had to be a good deal modified before he
could become the model of this Teutonic Esau. It is after the tradition
of his old relation to huntsmen that the Devil has been so especially
connected in folklore with soldiers. In the 'Annals of Leipzig,' kept
in Auerbach's Cellar, famous for the flight of Mephisto and Faust
from its window on a wine-cask, I found two other instances in which
the Devil was reported as having appeared in that town. In one case
(1604), the fiend had tempted one Jeremy of Strasburg, a marksman,
to commit suicide, but that not succeeding, had desired him to go with
him to the neighbouring castle and enjoy some fruit. The marksman was
saved by help of a Dean. In 1633, during a period of excessive cold
and snow, the Devil induced a soldier to blaspheme. The marksman and
the soldier were, indeed, the usual victims of the Wild Huntsmen's
temptations; and it was for such that the unfailing magic bullets
were moulded in return for their impawned souls.

How King Olaf--whose name lingers among us in 'Tooley Street,' so
famous for its Three Tailors! [189]--spread the Gospel through the
North after his baptism in England is well known. Whatever other hunt
may have been phantasmal, it was not Olaf's hunt of the heathen. To
put a pan of live coals under the belly of one, to force an adder
down the throat of another, to offer all men the alternatives of being
baptized or burnt, were the arguments which this apostle applied with
such energy that at last--but not until many brave martyrdoms--the
chief people were convinced. Olaf encountered [[Odin]] as if he had been a
living foe, and what is more, believed in the genuine existence of his
former God. Once, as Olaf and his friends believed, [[Odin]] appeared to
this devastator of his altars as a one-eyed man in broad-brimmed hat,
delighting the King in his hours of relaxation with that enchanting
conversation for which he was so famous. But he ([[Odin]]) tried secretly
to induce the cook to prepare for his royal master some fine meat
which he had poisoned. But Olaf said, '[[Odin]] shall not deceive us,'
and ordered the tempting viand to be thrown away. [[Odin]] was god of
the barbarian Junkers, and the people rejoiced that he was driven
into holes and corners; his rites remained mainly among huntsmen,
and had to be kept very secret. In the Gulathings Lagen of Norway
it is ordered: 'Let the king and bishop, with all possible care,
search after those who exercise pagan rites, who use magic arts, who
adore the genii of particular places, of tombs, or rivers, and who,
after the manner of devils in travelling, are transported from place
to place through the air.'

Under such very actual curses as these, the once sacred animals of
[[Odin]], and all the associations of the hunt, were diabolised. Even
the hunting-horn was regarded as having something praeternatural
about it. The howling blast when [[Odin]] consulteth Mimir's head [190]
was heard again in the Pied Piper's flute, and passed southward
to blend its note with the horn of Roland at Roncesvalles,--which
brought help from distances beyond the reach of any honest horn,
and even with the pipe of Pan.

That the Edda described [[Odin]] as mounted on a mysterious horse,
as cherishing two wolves for pets, having a roasted boar for the
daily piece de resistance of his table, and with a raven on either
shoulder, whispering to him the secret affairs of the earth, was
enough to settle the reputation of those animals in the creed of
christian priests. The Raven was, indeed, from of old endowed with
the holy awfulness of the christian dove, in the Norse Mythology. To
this day no Swede will kill a raven. The superstition concerning it
was strong enough to transmit even to Voltaire an involuntary shudder
at its croak. [[Odin]] was believed to have given the Raven the colour of
the night that it might the better spy out the deeds of darkness. Its
'natural theology' is, no doubt, given correctly by Robert Browning's
Caliban, who, when his speculations are interrupted by a thunderstorm,
supposes his soliloquy has been conveyed by the raven he sees flying
to his god Setebos. In many parts of Germany ravens are believed to
hold souls of the damned. If a raven's heart be secured it procures
an unerring shot.

From an early date the Boar became an ensign of the prowess of the
gods, by which its head passed to be the device of so many barbaric
clans and ancient families in the Northern world. In Vedic Mythology
we find Indra taking the shape of a Wild Boar, also killing a demon
Boar, and giving Tritas the strength by which a similar monster is
slain. [191] According to another fable, while Brahma and Vishnu are
quarrelling as to which is the first-born, Siva interferes and cries,
'I am the first-born; nevertheless I will recognise as my superior
him who is able to see the summit of my head or the sole of my
feet.' Vishnu, transforming himself to a Boar, pierced the ground,
penetrated to the infernal regions, and then saw the feet of Siva,
who on his return saluted him as first-born of the gods. De Gubernatis
regards this fable as making the Boar emblem of the hidden Moon. [192]
He is hunted by the Sun. He guards the treasure of the demons which
Indra gains by slaying him. In Sicilian story, Zafarana, by throwing
three hog's bristles on embers, renews her husband's youth. In
Esthonian legend, a prince, by eating pork, acquires the faculty
of understanding the language of birds,--which may mean leading on
the spring with its songs of birds. But whether these particular
interpretations be true or not, there is no doubt that the Boar,
at an early period, became emblematic of the wild forces of nature,
and from being hunted by King [[Odin]] on earth passed to be his favourite
food in Valhalla, and a prominent figure in his spectral hunt.

Enough has already been said of the Dog in several chapters of this
work to render it but natural that this animal should take his place
in any diabolical train. It was not as a 'hell-hound,' or descendant
of the guardians of Orcus, that he entered the spectral procession of
[[Odin]], but as man's first animal assistant in the work of obtaining a
living from nature. It is the faithful friend of man who is demoralised
in Waldemar's Lystig, the spectre-hound of Peel Castle, the Manthe
Doog of the Isle of Man, the sky-dogs (Cwn wybir or aunwy) of Wales,
and Roscommon dog of Ireland.

Of the Goat, the Dog, and some other diabolised animals, enough
has been said in previous pages. The nocturnal animals would be
as naturally caught up into the Wild Huntsman's train as belated
peasants. But it is necessary to dwell a little on the relations of
the Horse to this Wild Hunt. It was the Horse that made the primitive
king among men.

'The Horse,' says Dasent, 'was a sacred animal among the Teutonic
tribes from the first moment of their appearance in history; and
Tacitus has related how, in the shade of those woods and groves which
served them for temples, white horses were fed at the public cost,
whose backs no mortal crossed, whose neighings and snortings were
carefully watched as auguries and omens, and who were thought to be
conscious of divine mysteries. In Persia, too, the classical reader
will remember how the neighing of a horse decided the choice for the
crown. Here in England, at any rate, we have only to think of Hengist
and Horsa, the twin heroes of the Anglo-Saxon migration--as the legend
ran--heroes whose name meant horse, and of the Vale of the White Horse,
in Berks, where the sacred form still gleams along the down, to be
reminded of the sacredness of the horse to our forefathers. The Eddas
are filled with the names of famous horses, and the Sagas contain many
stories of good steeds, in whom their owners trusted and believed as
sacred to this or that particular god. Such a horse is Dapplegrimm
in the Norse tales, who saves his master out of all his perils, and
brings him to all fortune, and is another example of that mysterious
connection with the higher powers which animals in all ages have been
supposed to possess.'

It was believed that no warrior could approach Valhalla except on
horseback, and the steed was generally buried with his master. The
Scandinavian knight was accustomed to swear 'by the shoulder of a
horse and the edge of a sword.' [[Odin]] (the god) was believed to have
always near him the eight-legged horse Sleipnir, whose sire was the
wonderful Svaldilfari, who by night drew the enormous stones for the
fortress defending Valhalla from the frost-giants. On Sleipnir the
deity rode to the realm of Hela, when he evoked the spirit of the
deceased prophetess, Vala, with Runic incantations, to learn [[Baldur]]'s
fate. This is the theme of the Veytamsvida, paraphrased by Gray in
his ode beginning--


        Up rose the king of men with speed,
        And saddled straight his coal-black steed


The steed, however, was not black, but grey. Sleipnir was the foal of
a magically-created mare. The demon-mare (Mara) holds a prominent place
in Scandinavian superstition, besetting sleepers. In the Ynglinga Saga,
Vanland awakes from sleep, crying, 'Mara is treading on me!' His men
hasten to help him, but when they take hold of his head Mara treads
on his legs, and when they hold his legs she tramples on his head;
and so, says Thiodolf--


        Trampled to death, to Skyta's shore
        The corpse his faithful followers bore;
        And there they burnt, with heavy hearts,
        The good chief, killed by witchcraft's arts.


All this is, of course, the origin of the common superstition of
the nightmare. The horse-shoe used against witches is from the same
region. We may learn here also the reason why hippophagy has been so
long unknown among us. [[Odin]]'s boar has left his head on our Christmas
tables, but Olaf managed to rob us of the horse-flesh once eaten in
honour of that god. In the eleventh century he proclaimed the eating
of horse-flesh a test of paganism, as baptism was of Christianity,
and punished it with death, except in Iceland, where it was permitted
by an express stipulation on their embracing Christianity. To these
facts it may be added that originally the horse's head was lifted,
as the horse-shoe is now, for a charm against witches. When Wittekind
fought twenty years against Charlemagne, the ensign borne by his
Saxon followers was a horse's head raised on a pole. A white horse
on a yellow ground is to-day the Hanoverian banner, its origin being
undoubtedly Odinistic.

The christian edict against the eating of horse-flesh had probably
a stronger motive than sentimental opposition to paganism. A Roman
emperor had held the stirrup for a christian pontiff to mount,
and something of the same kind occurred in the North. The Horse,
which had been a fire-breathing devil under [[Odin]], became a steed of
the Sun under the baptized noble and the bishop. Henceforth we read
of coal-black and snow-white horses, as these are mounted in the
interest of the old religion or the new.

It is very curious to observe how far and wide has gone religious
competition for possession of that living tower of strength--the
Horse. In ancient Ceylon we find the Buddhist immigrants winning over
the steed on which the aborigines were fortified. It was a white horse,
of course, that became their symbol of triumph. The old record says--

'A certain yakkhini (demoness) named Chetiya, having the form and
countenance of a mare, dwelt near the marsh of Tumbariungona. A
certain person in the prince's (Pandukabhayo) retinue having seen this
beautiful (creature), white with red legs, announced the circumstance
to the prince. The prince set out with a rope to secure her. She
seeing him approach from behind, losing her presence of mind from
fear, under the influence of his imposing appearance, fled without
(being able to exert the power she possessed of) rendering herself
invisible. He gave chase to the fugitive. She, persevering in her
flight, made the circuit of the marsh seven times. She made three
more circuits of the marsh, and then plunged into the river at the
Kachchhaka ferry. He did the same, and (in the river) seized her
by the tail, and (at the same time grasped) the leaf of a palmira
tree which the stream was carrying down. By his supernatural good
fortune this (leaf) became an enormous sword. Exclaiming, 'I put
thee to death!' he flourished the sword over her. 'Lord!' replied
she to him, 'subduing this kingdom for thee, I will confer it on
thee: spare me my life.' Seizing her by the throat, and with the
point of the sword boring her nostril, he secured her with his rope:
she (instantly) became tractable. Conducting her to the Dhumarakkho
mountain, he obtained a great accession of warlike power by making her
his battle-steed.' [193] The wonderful victories won by the prince,
aided by this magical mare, are related, and the tale ends with his
setting up 'within the royal palace itself the mare-faced yakkhini,'
and providing for her annually 'demon offerings.'

Equally ambiguous with the Horse in this zoologic diablerie
is the Stag. In the Heraklean legends we find that hero's son,
Telephon, nursed by a hind in the woods; and on the other hand,
his third 'labour' was the capture of Artemis' gold-antlered stag,
which brought on him her wrath (it being 'her majesty's favourite
stag'). We have again the story of Actaeon pursuing the stag too far
and suffering the fate he had prepared for it; and a reminiscence
of it in the 'Pentamerone,' when the demon Huoreo allures Canneloro
into the wood by taking the form of a beautiful hind. These complex
legends are reflected in Northern folklore also. Count Otto I. of
Altmark, while out hunting, slept under an oak and dreamed that he
was furiously attacked by a stag, which disappeared when he called
on the name of God. The Count built a monastery, which still stands,
with the oak's stump built into its altar. On the other hand, beside
the altar of a neighbouring church hang two large horns of a stag
said to have brought a lost child home on its back. Thus in the old
town of Steindal meet these contrary characters of the mystical stag,
of which it is not difficult to see that the evil one results from its
misfortune in being at once the huntsman's victim and scapegoat. [194]

In the legend of St. Hubert we have the sign of Christ--risen
from his tomb among the rich Christians to share for a little the
crucifixion of their first missionaries in the North--to the huntsmen
of Europe. Hubert pursues the stag till it turns to face him, and
behold, between its antlers, the cross! It is a fable conceived in the
spirit of him who said to fishermen, 'Come with me and I will make you
fishers of men.' The effect was much the same in both cases. Hubert
kneels before the stag, and becomes a saint, as the fishermen left
their nets and became apostles. But, as the proverb says, when the
saint's day is over, farewell the saint. The fishermen's successors
caught men with iron hooks in their jaws; the successors of Hubert
hunted men and women so lustily that they never paused long enough
to see whether there might not be a cross on their forehead also.

It was something, however, that the cross which Constantine could
only see in the sky could be seen by any eye on the forehead of a
harmless animal; and this not only because it marked the rising in
christian hearts of pity for the animals, but because what was done to
the flying stag was done to the peasant who could not fly, and more
terribly. The vision of Hubert came straight from the pagan heart of
Western and Northern Europe. In the Bible, from Genesis to Apocalypse,
no word is found clearly inculcating any duty to the animals. So
little, indeed, could the christians interpret the beautiful tales
of folklore concerning kindly beasts, out of which came the legend
of Hubert, that Hubert was made patron of huntsmen; and while, by
a popular development, Wodan was degraded to a devil, the baptized
sportsman rescued his chief occupation by ascribing its most dashing
legends to St. Martin and their inspiration to the Archangel Michael.

It is now necessary to consider the light which the German heart cast
across the dark shadows of Wodan. This is to be discovered in the myth
of the White Lady. We have already seen, in the confessions of the
witches of Elfdale, in Sweden, that when they were gathering before
their formidable Devil, a certain White Spirit warned them back. The
children said she tried to keep them from entering the Devil's Church
at Blockula. This may not be worth much as a 'confession,' but it
sufficiently reports the theories prevailing in the popular mind of
Elfdale at that time. It is not doubtful now that this White Lady and
that Devil she opposed were, in pre-christian time, Wodan and his wife
Frigga. The humble people who had gladly given up the terrible huntsman
and warrior to be degraded into a Devil, and with him the barbaric
Nimrods who worshipped him, did not agree to a similar surrender
of their dear household goddess, known to them as Frigga, Holda,
Bertha, Mother Rose,--under all her epithets the Madonna of the North,
interceding between them and the hard king of Valhalla, ages before
they ever heard of a jealous Jehovah and a tender interceding Mary.

Dr. Wuttke has collected many variants of the myths of Frigga, some
of which bear witness to the efforts of the Church to degrade her
also into a fiend. She is seen washing white clothes at fountains,
milking cows, spinning flax with a distaff, or combing her flaxen
hair. She was believed to be the divine ancestress of the human
race; many of the oldest families claimed descent from her, and
believed that this Ahnenfrau announced to them good fortune, or,
by her wailing, any misfortune coming to their families. She brought
evil only to those who spoke evil of her. If any one shoots at her
the ball enters his own heart. She appears to poor wandering folk,
especially children, and guides them to spots where they find heaps
of gold covered with the flower called 'Forget-me-not'--because her
gentle voice is heard requesting, as the only compensation, that the
flowers shall be replaced when the gold is removed. The primroses are
sacred to her, and often are the keys (thence called 'key-blossoms')
which unlock her treasures. The smallest tribute she repays,--even a
pebble consecrated to her. Every child ascending the Burgeiser Alp
places a stone on a certain heap of such, with the words, 'Here I
offer to the wild maidens.' These are Bertha's kindly fairies. (When
Frederika Bremer was with a picnic on the Hudson heights, which
Washington Irving had peopled with the Spirits he had brought from
the Rhine, she preferred to pour out her champagne as a libation to
the 'good spirits' of Germany and America.) The beautiful White Lady
wears a golden chain, and glittering keys at her belt; she appears at
mid-day or in strong moonlight. In regions where priestly influence
is strong she is said to be half-black, half-white, and to appear
sometimes as a serpent. She often helps the weary farmer to stack
his corn, and sorely-tasked Cinderellas in their toil.

In pre-christian time this amiable goddess--called oftenest Bertha
(shining) and Mother Rose--was related to Wodan as the spring
and summer to the storms of winter, in which the Wild Huntsman's
procession no doubt originated. The Northman's experience of seed-time
and harvest was expressed in the myth of this sweet Rose hidden
through the winter's blight to rise again in summer. This myth has
many familiar variants, such as Aschenputtel and Sleeping Beauty;
but it was more particularly connected with the later legends of
the White Lady, as victim of the Wild Huntsman, by the stories of
transformed princesses delivered by youths. Rescue of the enchanted
princess is usually effected by three kisses, but she is compelled
to appear before the deliverer in some hideous aspect--as toad or
serpent; so that he is repelled or loses courage. This is the rose
hid under the ugliness of winter.

When the storm-god Wodan was banished from nature altogether and
identified with the imported, and naturally inconceivable, Satan, he
was no more regarded as Frigga's rough lord, but as her remorseless
foe. She was popularly revered as St. Walpurga, the original May
Queen, and it was believed that happy and industrious children
might sometimes see her on May-day with long flowing flaxen hair,
fine shoes, distaff in hand, and a golden crown on her head. But for
the nine nights after May-day she was relentlessly pursued by the
Wild Huntsman and his mounted train. There is a picture by G. Watts
of the hunted lady of Bocaccio's tale, now in the Cosmopolitan Club
of London, which vividly reproduces the weird impressiveness of this
myth. The White Lady tries to hide from her pursuer in standing corn,
or gets herself bound up in a sheaf. The Wild Huntsman's wrath extends
to all her retinue,--moss maidens of the wood, or Holtzweibeln. The
same belief characterises Waldemar's hunt. It is a common legend in
Denmark that King Volmer rode up to some peasants, busy at harvest
on Sobjerg Hill, and, in reply to his question whether they had
seen any game, one of the men said--'Something rustled just now in
yonder standing corn.' The King rushed off, and presently a shot was
heard. The King reappeared with a mermaid lying across his horse, and
said as he passed, 'I have chased her a hundred years, and have her at
last.' He then rode into the hill. In this way Frigga and her little
people, hunted with the wild creatures, awakened sympathy for them.

The holy friar. Eckhardt (who may be taken as a myth and type of the
Church ad hoc) gained his legendary fame by being supposed to go in
advance of the Wild Huntsman and warn villagers of his approach; but
as time went on and a compromise was effected between the hunting
Barons and the Church, on the basis that the sports and cruelties
should be paid for with indulgence-fees, Eckhardt had to turn his
attention rather to the White Lady. She was declared a Wild Huntress,
but the epithet slipped to other shoulders. The priests identified
her ultimately with Freija, or Frau Venus; and Eckhardt was the holy
hermit who warned young men against her sorceries in Venusberg and
elsewhere. But Eckhardt never prevailed against the popular love
of Mother Rose as he had against her pursuer; he only increased
the attractions of 'Frau Venus' beyond her deserts. In the end it
was as much as the Church could do to secure for Mary the mantle
of her elder sister's sanctity. Even then the earlier faith was not
eradicated. After the altars of Mary had fallen, Frigga had vitality
enough to hold her own as the White Witch who broke the Dark One's
spells. It was chiefly this helpful Mother-goddess to whom the wretched
were appealing when they were burnt for witchcraft.

At Urselberg, Wurtemberg, there is a deep hole called the
'Nightmaidens' Retreat,' in which are piled the innumerable stones that
have been cast therein by persons desiring good luck on journeys. These
stones correspond to the bones of the 11,000 Virgins in St. Ursula's
Church at Cologne. The White Lady was sainted under her name of Ursel
(the glowing one), otherwise Horsel. Horselberg, near Eisenach, became
her haunt as Venus, the temptress of Tannhausers; Urselberg became her
retreat as the good fairy mother; but the attractions of herself and
her moss-maidens, which the Church wished to borrow, were taken on a
long voyage to Rome, and there transmuted to St. Ursula and her 11,000
Virgins. These Saints of Cologne encountered their ancient mythical
pursuers--the Wild Huntsman's train--in those barbarian Huns who are
said to have slaughtered them all because they would not break their
vows of chastity. The legend is but a variant of Wodan's hunt after
the White Lady and her maidens. When it is remembered that before
her transformation by Christianity Ursula was the Huntsman's own
wife, Frigga, a quaint incident appears in the last meeting between
the two. After Wodan had been transformed to the Devil, he is said
to have made out the architectural plan for Cologne Cathedral, and
offered it to the architect in return for a bond for his soul; but,
having weakly allowed him to get possession of the document before
the bond was signed, the architect drew from under his gown a bone of
St. Ursula, from which the Devil fled in great terror. It was bone
of his bone; but after so many mythological vicissitudes Wodan and
his Horsel could hardly be expected to recognise each other at this
chance meeting in Cologne.







CHAPTER XXVII.

LE BON DIABLE.

The Devil repainted--Satan a divine agent--St. Orain's
heresy--Primitive universalism--Father Sinistrari--Salvation of
demons--Mediaeval sects--Aquinas--His prayer for Satan--Popular
antipathies--The Devil's gratitude--Devil defending
innocence--Devil against idle lords--The wicked ale-wife--Pious
offenders punished--Anachronistic Devils--Devils turn to
poems--Devil's good advice--Devil sticks to his word--His love
of justice--Charlemagne and the Serpent--Merlin--His prison of
Air--Mephistopheles in Heaven.


The phrase which heads this chapter is a favourite one in France. It
may have had a euphemistic origin, for the giants dreaded by primitive
Europeans were too formidable to be lightly spoken of. But within
most of the period concerning which we have definite knowledge such
phrases would more generally have expressed the half-contemptuous pity
with which these huge beings with weak intellects were regarded. The
Devil imported with Christianity was made over, as we have seen,
into the image of the Dummeteufel, or stupid good-natured giant, and
he is represented in many legends which show him giving his gifts and
services for payments of which he is constantly cheated. Le Bon Diable
in France is somewhat of this character, and is often taken as the
sign of tradesmen who wish to represent themselves as lavishing their
goods recklessly for inadequate compensation. But the large accession
of demons and devils from the East through Jewish and Moslem channels,
of a character far from stupid, gave a new sense to that phrase and
corresponding ones. There is no doubt that a very distinct reaction
in favour of the Devil arose in Europe, and one expressive of very
interesting facts and forces. The pleasant names given him by the
masses would alone indicate this,--Monsieur De Scelestat, Lord Voland,
Blumlin (floweret), Federspiel (gay-plumed), Maitre Bernard, Maitre
Parsin (Parisian).

The Devil is not so black as he's painted. This proverb concerning the
long-outlawed Evil One has a respectable antiquity, and the feeling
underlying it has by no means been limited to the vulgar. Even the
devout George Herbert wrote--


            We paint the Devil black, yet he
            Hath some good in him all agree.


Robert Burns naively appeals to Old Nick's better nature--


            But fare ye weel, auld Nickie-ben!
            O wad ye tak a thought an' men'!
            Ye aiblins might--I dinna ken--
                          Still ha'e a stake;
            I'm wae to think upon yon den,
                          E'en for your sake!


It is hard to destroy the natural sentiments of the human
heart. However much they may be overlaid by the transient exigencies
of a creed, their indestructible nature is pretty certain to reveal
itself. The most orthodox supporters of divine cruelty in their
own theology will cry out against it in another. The saint who is
quite satisfied that the everlasting torture of Satan or Judas is
justice, will look upon the doom of Prometheus as a sign of heathen
heartlessness; and the burning of one widow for a few moments on
her husband's pyre will stimulate merciful missionary ardour among
millions of christians whose creed passes the same poor victim to
endless torture, and half the human race with her.

It is doubtful whether the general theological conception of the
functions of Satan is consistent with the belief that he is in a state
of suffering. As an agent of divine punishment he is a part of the
divine government; and it is even probable that had it not been for
the necessity of keeping up his office, theology itself would have
found some means of releasing him and his subordinates from hell,
and ultimately of restoring them to heaven and virtue. [195]

It is a legend of the island Iona that when St. Columba attempted to
build a church there, the Devil--i.e., the same Druid magicians who
tried to prevent his landing there by tempests--threw down the stones
as often as they were piled up. An oracle declared that the church
could arise only after some holy man had been buried alive at the spot,
and the saint's friend Orain offered himself for the purpose. After
Orain had been buried, and the wall was rising securely, St. Columba
was seized with a strong desire to look upon the face of his poor
friend once more. The wall was pulled down, the body dug up; but
instead of Orain being found dead, he sat up and told the assembled
christians around him that he had been to the other world, and
discovered that they were in error about various things,--especially
about Hell, which really did not exist at all. Outraged by this heresy
the christians immediately covered up Orain again in good earnest.

The resurrection of this primitive universalist of the seventh century,
and his burial again, may be regarded as typifying a dream of the
ultimate restoration of the universe to the divine sway which has
often given signs of life through christian history, though many times
buried. The germ of it is even in Paul's hope that at last 'God may be
all in all' (1 Cor. xv. 28). In Luke x. 17, also, it was related that
the seventy whom Jesus had sent out among the idol-worshipping Gentiles
'returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject
unto us through thy name.' These ideas are recalled in various legends,
such as that elsewhere related of the Satyr who came to St. Anthony to
ask his prayers for the salvation of his demonic tribe. On the strength
of Anthony's courteous treatment of that Satyr, the famous Consulteur
of the Inquisition, Father Sinistrari (seventeenth century), rested
much of his argument that demons were included in the atonement wrought
by Christ and might attain final beatitude. The Father affirmed that
this was implied in Christ's words, 'Other sheep I have which are not
of this flock: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice;
and there shall be one fold and one shepherd' [196] (John x. 16). That
these words were generally supposed to refer to the inclusion of the
Gentile world was not accepted by Sinistrari as impairing his argument,
but the contrary. He maintained with great ingenuity that the salvation
of the Gentiles logically includes the salvation of their inspiring
demons, and that there would not be one fold if these aerial beings,
whose existence all authorities attested, were excluded. He even
intimates, though more timidly, that their father, Satan himself,
as a participator in the sin of Adam and sharer of his curse, may
be included in the general provision of the deity for the entire and
absolute removal of the curse throughout nature.

Sinistrari's book was placed on the 'Index Expurgatorius' at Rome in
1709, 'donec corrigatur,' eight years after the author's death; it was
republished, 'correctus,' 1753. But the fact that such sentiments had
occupied many devout minds in the Church, and that they had reached
the dignity of a consistent and scholarly statement in theology, was
proved. The opinion grew out of deeper roots than New Testament phrases
or the Anthony fables. The Church had been for ages engaged in the vast
task of converting the Gentile world; in the course of that task it had
succeeded only by successive surrenders of the impossible principles
with which it had started. The Prince of this World had been baptized
afresh with every European throne ascended by the Church. Asmodeus
had triumphed in the sacramental inclusion of marriage; St. Francis
d'Assisi, preaching to the animals, represented innumerable pious
myths which had been impossible under the old belief in a universal
curse resting upon nature. The evolution of this tendency may be
traced through the entire history of the Church in such sects as the
Paulicians, Cathari, Bogomiles, and others, who, though they again
and again formulated anew the principle of an eternal Dualism, as
often revealed some further stage in the progressive advance of the
christianised mind towards a normal relation with nature. Thus the
Cathari maintained that only those beings who were created by the
evil principle would remain unrecovered; those who were created by
God, but seduced by the Adversary, would be saved after sufficient
expiation. The fallen angels, they believed, were passing through
earthly, in some cases animal, bodies to the true Church and to
heaven. Such views as these were not those of the learned, but of the
dissenting sects, and they prepared ignorant minds in many countries
for that revival of confidence in their banished deities which made
the cult of Witchcraft.

St. Thomas Aquinas, the 'Angelical Doctor,' in his famous work
'Summa Theologiae,' maintains that in the Resurrection the bodies of
the redeemed will rise with all their senses and organs, including
those of sex, active and refined. The authentic affirmation of that
doctrine in the thirteenth century was of a significance far beyond
the comprehension of the Church. Aquinas confused the lines between
flesh and spirit, especially by admitting sex into heaven. The Devil
could not be far behind. The true interpretation of his doctrine is to
be found in the legend that Aquinas passed a night in prayer for the
salvation and restoration of the Devil. This legend is the subject
of a modern poem so fraught with the spirit of the mediaeval heart,
pining in its dogmatic prison, that I cannot forbear quoting it here:--


            All day Aquinas sat alone;
            Compressed he sat and spoke no word,
            As still as any man of stone,
            In streets where never voice is heard;
            With massive front and air antique
            He sat, did neither move or speak,
            For thought like his seemed words too weak.

            The shadows brown about him lay;
            From sunrise till the sun went out,
            Had sat alone that man of grey,
            That marble man, hard crampt by doubt;
            Some kingly problem had he found,
            Some new belief not wholly sound,
            Some hope that overleapt all bound.

            All day Aquinas sat alone,
            No answer to his question came,
            And now he rose with hollow groan,
            And eyes that seemed half love, half flame.
            On the bare floor he flung him down,
            Pale marble face, half smile, half frown,
            Brown shadow else, mid shadows brown.

            'O God,' he said, 'it cannot be,
            Thy Morning-star, with endless moan,
            Should lift his fading orbs to thee,
            And thou be happy on thy throne.
            It were not kind, nay, Father, nay,
            It were not just, O God, I say,
            Pray for thy Lost One, Jesus, pray!

            'How can thy kingdom ever come,
            While the fair angels howl below?
            All holy voices would be dumb,
            All loving eyes would fill with woe,
            To think the lordliest Peer of Heaven,
            The starry leader of the Seven,
            Would never, never, be forgiven.

            'Pray for thy Lost One, Jesus, pray!
            O Word that made thine [[angel]] speak!
            Lord! let thy pitying tears have way;
            Dear God! not man alone is weak.
            What is created still must fall,
            And fairest still we frailest call;
            Will not Christ's blood avail for all?

            'Pray for thy Lost One, Jesus, pray!
            O Father! think upon thy child;
            Turn from thy own bright world away,
            And look upon that dungeon wild.
            O God! O Jesus! see how dark
            That den of woe! O Saviour! mark
            How angels weep, how groan! Hark, hark!

            'He will not, will not do it more,
            Restore him to his throne again;
            Oh, open wide that dismal door
            Which presses on the souls in pain.
            So men and angels all will say,
            'Our God is good.' Oh, day by day,
            Pray for thy Lost One, Jesus, pray!'

            All night Aquinas knelt alone,
            Alone with black and dreadful Night,
            Until before his pleading moan
            The darkness ebbed away in light.
            Then rose the saint, and 'God,' said he,
            'If darkness change to light with thee,
            The Devil may yet an [[angel]] be.' [197]


While this might be the feeling of devout philosophers whose minds
were beginning to form a conception of a Cosmos in which the idea
of a perpetual empire of Evil could find no place, the humble and
oppressed masses, as we have seen in the chapter on Witchcraft,
were familiarising their minds with the powers and glories of a
Satan in antagonism to the deities and saints of the Church. It was
not a penitent devil supplicating for pardon whom they desired, but
the veritable Prince of the World, to whom as well as to themselves
their Christian oppressors were odious. They invested the Powers which
the priests pronounced infernal with those humanly just and genial
qualities that had been discarded by ecclesiastical ambition. The
legends which must be interpreted in this sense are very numerous,
and a few of the most characteristic must suffice us here. The habit of
attributing every mishap to the Devil was rebuked in many legends. One
of these related that when a party were driving over a rough road
the waggon broke down and one of the company exclaimed, 'This is a
bit of the Devil's work!' A gentleman present said, 'It is a bit of
corporation work. I don't believe in saddling the Devil with all the
bad roads and bad axles.' Some time after, when this second speaker was
riding over the same road alone, an old gentleman in black met him,
and having thanked him for his defence of the Devil, presented him
with a casket of splendid jewels. Very numerous are legends of the
Devil's apparition to assist poor architects and mechanics unable
to complete their contracts, even carving beautiful church pillars
and the like for them, and this sometimes without receiving any
recompense. The Devil's apparition in defence of accused innocence is
a well-known feature of European folklore. On one occasion a soldier,
having stopped at a certain inn, confided to the innkeeper some money
he had for safe-keeping, and when he was about to leave the innkeeper
denied having received the deposit. The soldier battered down the door,
and the neighbours of the innkeeper, a prominent man in the town,
put him in prison, where he lay in prospect of suffering death for an
attempted burglary. The poor soldier, being a stranger without means,
was unable to obtain counsel to defend him. When the parties appeared
before the magistrate, a smart young lawyer, with blue hat and white
feathers, unknown in the town, volunteered to defend the soldier,
and related the whole story with such effect that the innkeeper in his
excitement cried, 'Devil take me if I have the money!' Instantly the
smart lawyer spread his wings, and, seizing the innkeeper, disappeared
with him through the roof of the court-room. The innkeeper's wife,
struck with horror, restored the money. In an Altmark version of
this story the Devil visits the prisoner during the previous night
and asks for his soul as fee, but the soldier refuses, saying he had
rather die. Despite this the Devil intervened. It was an old-time
custom in Denmark for courts to sit with an open window, in order
that the Devil might more easily fly away with the perjurer.

Always a democrat, the Devil is said in many stories to have interfered
in favour of the peasant or serf against the noble. On one occasion he
relieved a certain district of all its arrogant and idle noblemen by
gathering them up in a sack and flying away with them; but unhappily,
as he was passing over the town of Friesack, his sack came in collision
with the church steeple, and through the hole so torn a large number
of noble lords fell into the town--which thence derived its name--and
there they remained to be patrons of the steeple and burthens on
the people.

The Devil was universally regarded as a Nemesis on all publicans and
ale-wives who adulterated the beer they dealt out to the people, or
gave short measures. At Reetz, in Altmark, the legend of an ale-wife
with whom he flew away is connected with a stone on which they are said
to have rested, and the villagers see thereon prints of the Devil's
hoof and the woman's feet. This was a favourite theme of old English
legends. The accompanying Figure (23), one of the misereres in Ludlow
parish church, Shropshire, represents the end of a wicked ale-wife. A
devil on one side reads the long list of her shortcomings, and on the
other side hell-mouth is receiving other sinners. A devil with bagpipe
welcomes her arrival. She carries with her only her fraudulent measure
and the fashionable head-dress paid for out of its wicked gains.

In a marionette performance which I witnessed at Tours, the accusations
brought against the tradesmen who cheated the people were such as to
make one wish that the services of some equally strict devil could
be secured by the authorities of all cities, to detect adulterators
and dealers in false weights and measures. The same retributive
agency, in the popular interest, was ascribed to the Devil in his
attitude towards misers. There being no law which could reach men
whose hoarded wealth brought no good to themselves or others, such
were deemed proper cases for the interposition of the Devil. There
is a significant contrast between the legends favoured by the Church
and those of popular origin. The former, made prominent in frescoes,
often show how, at the weighing of souls, the sinner is saved by a
saint or [[angel]], or by some instance of service to the Church being
placed in the scale against the otherwise heavier record of evil
deeds. A characteristic legend is that which is the subject of the
frescoes in the portico of St. Lorenzo Church at Rome (thirteenth
century). St. Lawrence sees four devils passing his hermitage, and
learns from them that they are going for the soul of Henry II. In
the next scene, when the wicked Count is weighed, the scroll of his
evil deeds far outweighs that of his good actions, until the Saint
casts into the scale a chalice which the prince had once given to his
church. For that one act Henry's soul ascends to paradise amid the
mortification of the Devils. Though Charles Martel saved Europe from
Saracen sway, he once utilised episcopal revenues for relief of the
state; consequently a synod declares him damned, a saint sees him in
hell, a sulphurous dragon issues from his grave. On the other hand,
the popular idea of the fate of distinguished sinners may be found
hid under misereres, where kings sometimes appear in Hell, and in
the early picture-books which contained a half-christianised folklore.

It has been observed that the early nature-deities, reflecting the
evil and good of nature, in part through the progress of human
thought and ideality, and through new ethnical rivalries, were
degraded into demons. They then represented the pains, obstructions,
and fears in nature. We have seen that as these apparent external
evils were vanquished or better understood, the demons passed
to the inward nature, and represented a new series of pains,
obstructions, and fears. But these, too, were in part vanquished, or
better understood. Still more, they so changed their forms that the
ancient demons-turned-devils were no longer sufficiently expressive
to represent them. Thus we find that the Jews, mohammedans, and
christians did not find their several special antagonists impressively
represented by either Satan, Iblis, or Beelzebub. Each, therefore,
personified its foe in accordance with later experiences--an Opponent
called Armillus, Aldajjail, Antichrist (all meaning the same thing),
in whom all other devils were merged.

As to their spirit; but as to their forms they shrank in size and
importance, and did duty in small ways. We have seen how great dragons
were engaged in frightening boys who fished on Sundays, or oppressive
squires; how Satan presided over wine-casks, or was adapted to the
punishment of profanity; how hosts of once tremendous fiends turned
into the grotesque little forms which Callot, truly copying the popular
notions around him, painted as motley imps disturbing monks at their
prayers. Such diminutions of the devils correspond to a parallel
process among the gods and goddesses, by which they were changed to
'little people' or fairies. In both cases the transformation is an
expression of popular disbelief in their reality.

But revivals took place. The fact of evil is permanent; and whenever
the old chains of fear, after long rusting, finally break, there
follows an insurrection against the social and moral order which
alarms the learned and the pious. These see again the instigations
of evil powers, and it takes form in the imagination of a Dante,
a Luther, a Milton. But when these new portraits of the Devil are
painted, it is with so much contemporary colouring that they do not
answer to the traditional devils preserved in folklore. Dante's Worm
does not resemble the serpent of fable, nor does Milton's Satan
answer to the feathered clown of Miracle Plays. Thus, behind the
actual evils which beset any time, there stands an array of grand
diabolical names, detached from present perils, on which the popular
fancy may work without really involving any theory of Absolute Evil
at all. Were starry Lucifer to be restored to his heavenly sphere,
he would be one great brand plucked from the burning, but the burning
might still go on. Theology itself had filled the world with other
devils by diabolising all the gods and goddesses of rival religions,
and the compassionate heart was thus left free to select such forms or
fair names as preserved some remnant of ancient majesty around them,
or some ray from their once divine halo, and pray or hope for their
pardon and salvation. Fallen foes, no longer able to harm, can hardly
fail to awaken pity and clemency.

With the picture of Dives and Lazarus presented elsewhere
(vol. i. p. 281) may be instructively compared the accompanying
scene of a rich man's death-bed (Fig. 24), taken from 'Ars Moriendi,'
one of the early block-books. This picture is very remarkable from
the suggestion it contains of an opposition between a devil on the
dying man's right and the hideous dragon on his left. While the
dragon holds up a scroll, bidding him think of his treasure (Yntende
thesauro), the Devil suggests provision for his friends (Provideas
amicis). This devil seems to be a representative of the rich man's
relatives who stand near, and appears to be supported by his ugly
superior, who points towards hell as the penalty of not making such
provision as is suggested. There would appear to be in this picture
a vague distinction between the mere bestial fiend who tempts, and
the ugly but good-natured devil who punishes, and whom rich sinners
cannot escape by bequests to churches.

One of the most notable signs of the appearance of 'the good Devil'
was the universal belief that he invariably stuck to his word. In
all European folklore there is no instance of his having broken a
promise. In this respect his reputation stands far higher than that
of the christians, seeing that it was a boast of the saints that,
following the example of their godhead, who outwitted Satan in the
bargain for man's redemption, they were continually cheating the
Devil by technical quibbles. There is a significant saying found
among Prussian and Danish peasants, that you may obtain a thing by
calling on Jesus, but if you would be sure of it you must call on
the Devil! The two parties were judged by their representatives.

One of the earliest legendary compacts with the Devil was that made
by St. Theophilus in the sixth century; when he became alarmed and
penitent, the Virgin Mary managed to trick Satan out of the fatal
bond. The 'Golden Legend' of Jacobus de Voragine tells why Satan was
under the necessity of demanding in every case a bond signed with
blood. 'The christians,' said Satan, 'are cheats; they make all sorts
of promises so long as they want me, and then leave me in the lurch,
and reconcile themselves with Christ so soon as, by my help, they
have got what they want.'

Even apart from the consideration of possessing the soul, the
ancient office of Satan as legal prosecutor of souls transmitted,
to the latest forms into which he was modified, this character for
justice. Many mediaeval stories report his gratitude whenever he is
treated with justice, though some of these are disguised by connection
with other demonic forms. Such is the case with the following romance
concerning Charlemagne.

When Charlemagne dwelt at Zurich, in the house commonly called 'Zum
Loch,' he had a column erected to which a bell was attached by a
rope. Any one that demanded justice could ring this bell when the
king was at his meals. It happened one day that the bell sounded,
but when the servants went to look no one was there. It continued
ringing, so the Emperor commanded them to go again and find out the
cause. They now remarked that an enormous serpent approached the rope
and pulled it. Terrified, they brought the news to the Emperor, who
immediately rose in order to administer justice to beast as well as
man. After the reptile had respectfully inclined before the emperor,
it led him to the banks of the river and showed him, sitting upon
its nest and eggs, an enormous toad. Charlemagne having examined
the case decided thus:--The toad was condemned to be burnt and
justice shown to the serpent. The verdict was no sooner given than
it was accomplished. A few days after the snake returned to court,
bowed low to the King, crept upon the table, took the cover from a
gold goblet standing there, dropped into it a precious stone, bowed
again and crept away. On the spot where the serpent's nest had been,
Charlemagne built a church called 'Wasserkelch.' The stone he gave
to his much-loved spouse. This stone possessed the power of making
the owner especially loved by the Emperor, so that when absent from
his queen he mourned and longed for her. She, well aware that if
it came into other hands the Emperor would soon forget her, put it
under her tongue in the hour of death. The queen was buried with
the stone, but Charlemagne could not separate himself from the body,
so had it exhumed, and for eighteen years carried it about with him
wherever he went. In the meantime, a courtier who had heard of the
secret virtue of the stone, searched the corpse, and at last found
the stone hidden under the tongue, and took it away and concealed it
on his own person. Immediately the Emperor's love for his wife turned
to the courtier, whom he now scarcely permitted out of his sight. At
Cologne the courtier in a fit of anger threw the stone into a hot
spring, and since then no one has succeeded in finding it. The love
the Emperor had for the knight ceased, but he felt himself wonderfully
attracted to the place where the stone lay hidden. On this spot he
founded Aix-la-Chapelle, his subsequent favourite place of residence.

It is not wonderful that the tradition should arise at Aix, founded
by the human hero of this romance, that the plan of its cathedral
was supplied by the Devil; but it is characteristic there should be
associated with this legend an example of how he who as a serpent
was awarded justice by Charlemagne was cheated by the priests of
Aix. The Devil gave the design on condition that he was to have the
first who entered the completed cathedral, and a wolf was goaded into
the structure in fulfilment of the contract!

In the ancient myth and romaunt of 'Merlin' may be found the mediaeval
witness to the diabolised religion of Britain. The emasculated
saints of the South-east could not satisfy the vigorous race in the
North-west, and when its gods were outlawed as devils they brought
the chief of them back, as it were, had him duly baptized and set
about his old work in the form of Merlin! Here, side by side with the
ascetic Jesus, brought by Gatien and Augustin, was a Northern Christ,
son of an Arch-incubus, born of a Virgin, baptized in the shrunken
Jordan of a font, performing miracles, summoning dragons to his aid,
overcoming Death and Hell in his way, brought before his Pilate but
confounding him, throning and dethroning kings, and leading forth, on
the Day of Pentecost, an army whose knights are inspired by Guenever's
kisses in place of flaming tongues. How Merlin 'went about doing good,'
after the Northman's ideal of such work; how he saved the life of his
unwedded mother by proving that her child (himself) was begotten by
a devil without her knowledge; how, as a child, he exposed at once
the pretension of the magistrate to high birth and the laxity of his
lady and his parson; how he humiliated the priestly astrologers of
Vortigern, and prophesied the destruction of that usurper just as
it came to pass; how he served Uther during his seven years' reign,
and by enabling him to assume the shape of the Duke of Cornwall
and so enjoy the embraces of the Duchess Igerna, secured the birth
of Arthur and hope of the Sangreal; [198] how he defended Arthur's
legitimacy of birth and assisted him in causing illegitimate births;
and how at last he was bound by his own spells, wielded by Vivien,
in a prison of air where he now remains;--this was the great mediaeval
gospel of a baptized christian Antichrist which superseded the imported
kingdom not of this world.

Merlin was the Good Devil, but baptism was a fatal Vivien-spell to
him. He still dwells in all the air which is breathed by Anglo-Saxon
men,--an ever-expanding prison! Whether the Briton is transplanted in
America, India, or Africa, he still carries with him the Sermon on the
Mount as inspired by his baptized Prince of the Air, and his gospel
of the day is, 'If thine enemy hunger, starve him; if he thirst, give
him fire; if he hate you, heap melted lead on his head!' Such remains
the soul of the greatest race, under the fatal spell of a creed that
its barbarism needs only baptism to be made holiness and virtue.

In the reign of George II., when Lord Bute and a Princess of easy
virtue were preying on England, and fanatical preachers were
directing their donkeys to heaven beside the conflagration of
John Bull's house, the eye of Hogarth at least (as is shown in our
Figure 25, from his 'Raree Show') was able to see what the baptized
Merlin had become in his realm of Air. The other worldly-Devil is
serpent-legged Hypocrisy. The Nineteenth Century has replaced Merlin
by Mephistopheles, the Devil who, despite a cloven foot, steps firmly
on earth, and means the power that wit and culture can bring against
the baptized giant Force. Him the gods fear not, even look upon with
satisfaction. In the 'Prologue in Heaven,' of Goethe's 'Faust,' the
Lord is even more gracious to Mephistopheles than the Jehovah of Job
was to Satan. 'The like of thee have never moved my hate,' he says--


    Man's active nature, flagging, seeks too soon the level;
    Unqualified repose he learns to crave;
    Whence, willingly, the comrade him I gave,
    Who works, excites, and must create, as Devil.


This is but a more modern expression of the rabbinical fable,
already noted, that when the first man was formed there were beside
him two Spirits,--one on the right that remained quiescent, another
on the left who ever moved restlessly up and down. When the first
sin was committed, he of the left was changed to a devil. But he
still meant the progressive, inquiring nature of man. 'The Spirit I,
that evermore denies,' says the Mephistopheles of Goethe. How shall
man learn truth if he know not the Spirit that denies? How shall
he advance if he know not the Spirit of discontent? This restless
spirit gains through his ignorance a cloven hoof,--a divided movement,
sometimes right, sometimes wrong. From his selfishness it acquires
a double tongue. But both hoof and serpent-tongue are beneath the
evolutional power of experience; they shall be humanised to the foot
that marches firmly on earth, and the tongue that speaks truth; and,
the baptismal spell broken, Merlin shall descend, bringing to man's
aid all his sharp-eyed dragons transformed to beautiful Arts.

'The christians,' said Celsus, 'dream of some antagonist to God--a
devil, whom they call Satanas, who thwarted God when he wished to
benefit mankind. The Son of God suffered death from Satanas, but
they tell us we are to defy him, and to bear the worst he can do;
Satanas will come again and work miracles, and pretend to be God,
but we are not to believe him. The Greeks tell of a war among the
gods; army against army, one led by Saturn, and one by Ophincus; of
challenges and battles; the vanquished falling into the ocean, the
victors reigning in heaven. In the Mysteries we have the rebellion
of the Titans, and the fables of Typhon, and Horus, and Osiris. The
story of the Devil plotting against man is stranger than either of
these. The Son of God is injured by the Devil, and charges us to
fight against him at our peril. Why not punish the Devil instead of
threatening poor wretches whom he deceives?' [199]

The christians comprehended as little as their critic that story
they brought, stranger than all the legends of besieged deities, of a
Devil plotting against man. Yet a little historic perspective makes
the situation simple: the gods had taken refuge in man, therefore
the attack was transferred to man.

Priestly legends might describe the gods as victorious over the
Titans, the wild forces of nature, but the people, to their sorrow,
knew better; the priests, in dealing with the people, showed that
they also knew the victory to be on the other side. A careful writer
remarks:--'When these (Greek) divinities are in any case appealed to
with unusual seriousness, their nature-character reappears.... When
Poseidon hesitates to defer to the positive commands of Zeus
(Il. xix. 259), Iris reminds him that there are the Erinnyes to
be reckoned with (Il. xv. 204), and he gives in at once. [200] The
Erinnyes represent the steady supremacy of the laws and forces of
nature over all personifications of them. Under uniform experience
man had come to recognise his own moral autocracy in his world. He
looked for incarnations, and it was a hope born of an atheistic view
of external nature. This was the case not only with the evolution of
Greek religion, but in that of every religion.

When man's hope was thus turned to rest upon man, he found that
all the Titans had followed him. Ophincus (Ophion) had passed
through Ophiomorphus to be a Man of Sin; and this not in one, but
by corresponding forms in every line of religious development. The
ferocities of outward nature appeared with all their force in man, and
renewed their power with the fine armoury of his intelligence. He must
here contend with tempests of passion, stony selfishness, and the whole
animal creation nestling in heart and brain, prowling still, though on
two feet. The theory of evolution is hardly a century old as science,
but it is an ancient doctrine of Religion. The fables of Pilpay and
Aesop represent an early recognition of 'survivals.' Recurrence to
original types was recognised as a mystical phenomenon in legends of
the bandit turned wolf, and other transformations. One of the oldest
doctrines of Eschatology is represented in the accompanying picture
(Fig. 26), from Thebes, of two dog-headed apes ferrying over to Hades
a gluttonous soul that has been weighed before Osiris, and assigned
his appropriate form.

The devils of Lust are so innumerable that several volumes would be
required to enumerate the legends and superstitions connected with
them. But, fortunately for my reader and myself, these, more than
any other class of phantoms, are very slight modifications of the
same form. The innumerable phallic deities, the incubi and succubae,
are monotonous as the waves of the ocean, which might fairly typify
the vast, restless, and stormy expanse of sexual nature to which
they belong.

In 'The Golden Legend' there is a pleasant tale of a gentleman
who, having fallen into poverty, went into solitude, and was there
approached by a chevalier in black, mounted on a fine horse. This
knight having inquired the reason of the other's sadness, promised
him that, if he would return home, he would find at a certain place
vast sums of gold; but this was on condition that he should bring his
beautiful wife to that solitary spot in exactly a year's time. The
gentleman, having lived in greater splendour than ever during the
year, asked his wife to ride out with him on the appointed day. She
was very pious, and having prayed to the Virgin, accompanied her
husband to the spot. There the gentleman in black met them, but only
to tremble. 'Perfidious man!' he cried, 'is it thus you repay my
benefits? I asked you to bring your wife, and you have brought me
the Mother of God, who will send me back to hell!' The Devil having
vanished, the gentleman fell on his knees before the Virgin. He
returned home to find his wife sleeping quietly.

Were we to follow this finely-mounted gentleman in black, we should be
carried by no uncertain steps back to those sons of God who took unto
themselves wives of the daughters of men, as told in Genesis; and if
we followed the Virgin, we should, by less certain but yet probable
steps, discover her prototype in Eve before her fall, virginal as
she was meant to remain so far as man was concerned. In the chapters
relating to the Eden myth and its personages, I have fully given my
reasons for believing that the story of Eve, the natural childlessness
of Sarah, and the immaculate conception by Mary, denote, as sea-rocks
sometimes mark the former outline of a coast, a primitive theory
of celibacy in connection with that of a divine or Holy Family. It
need only be added here that this impossible ideal in its practical
development was effectual in restraining the sexual passions of
mankind. Although the reckless proclamation of the wild nature-gods
(Elohim), 'Be fruitful and multiply,' has been accepted by christian
bibliolators as the command of Jehovah, and philanthropists are even
punished for suggesting means of withstanding the effects of nuptial
licentiousness, yet they are farther from even the letter of the Bible
than those protestant celibates, the American Shakers, who discard
the sexual relation altogether. The theory of the Shakers that the
functions of sex 'belong to a state of nature, and are inconsistent
with a state of grace,' as one of their members in Ohio stated it to
me, coincides closely with the rabbinical theory that Adam and Eve,
by their sin, fell to the lowest of seven earthly spheres, and thus
came within the influence of the incubi and succubae, by their union
with whom the world was filled with the demonic races, or Gentiles.

It is probable that the fencing-off of Eden, the founding of the
Abrahamic household and family, and the command against adultery, were
defined against that system of rape--or marriage by capture--which
prevailed among the 'sons of Elohim,' who saw the 'daughters of men
that they were fair,' and followed the law of their eyes. The older
rabbins were careful to preserve the distinction between the Bene
Elohim and the Ischim, and it ultimately amounted to that between
Jews and Gentiles.

The suspicion of a devil lurking behind female beauty thus begins. The
devils love beauty, and the beauties love admiration. These are perils
in the constitution of the family. But there are other legends which
report the frequency with which woman was an unwilling victim of the
lustful Anakim or other powerful lords. Throughout the world are
found legends of beautiful virgins sacrificed to powerful demons
or deities. These are sometimes so realistic as to suggest the
possibility that the fair captives of savage chieftains may indeed
have been sometimes victims of their Ogre's voracity as well as his
lust. At any rate, cruelty and lust are nearly related. The Blue
Beard myth opens out horrible possibilities.

One of the best-known legends in Japan is that concerning the
fiend Shudendozi, who derives his name from the two characteristics
of possessing the face of a child and being a heavy drinker. The
child-face is so emphasised in the stories that one may suspect either
that his fair victims were enticed to his stronghold by his air of
innocence, or else that there is some hint as to maternal longings
in the fable.

At the beginning of the eleventh century, when Ichijo II. was Emperor,
lived the hero Yorimitsa. In those days the people of Kiyoto were
troubled by an evil spirit which abode near the Rasho Gate. One night,
when merry with his companions, Ichijo said, 'Who dare go and defy
the demon of the Rasho Gate, and set up a token that he has been
there?' 'That dare I,' answered Tsuma, who, having donned his mail,
rode out in the bleak night to the Rasho Gate. Having written his
name on the gate, returning, his horse shivers with fear, and a
huge hand coming out of the gate seized the knight's helmet. He
struggled in vain. He then cuts off the demon's arm, and the demon
flies howling. Tsuma takes the demon's arm home, and locks it in a
box. One night the demon, having the shape of Tsuma's aunt, came and
said, 'I pray you show me the arm of the fiend.' 'I will show it to
no man, and yet to thee will I show it,' replied he. When the box
is opened a black cloud enshrouds the aunt, and the demon disappears
with the arm. Thereafter he is more troublesome than ever. The demon
carried off the fairest virgins of Kiyoto, ravished and ate them,
no beauty being left in the city. The Emperor commands Yorimitsa to
destroy him. The hero, with four trusty knights and a great captain,
went to the hidden places of the mountains. They fell in with an
old man, who invited them into his dwelling, and gave them wine to
drink; and when they were going he presented them with wine. This
old man was a mountain-god. As they proceeded they met a beautiful
lady washing blood from garments in a valley, weeping bitterly. In
reply to their inquiries she said the demon had carried her off
and kept her to wash his clothes, meaning when weary of her to
eat her. 'I pray your lordships to help me!' The six heroes bid
her lead them to the ogre's cave. One hundred devils mounted guard
before it. The woman first went in and told him they had come. The
ogre called them in, meaning to eat them. Then they saw Shudendozi,
a monster with the face of a little child. They offered him wine,
which flew to his head: he becomes merry and sleeps, and his head is
cut off. The head leaps up and tries to bite Yorimitsa, but he had
on two helmets. When all the devils are slain, he brings the head
of Shudendozi to the Emperor. In a similar story of the same country
the lustful ogre by no means possesses Shudendozi's winning visage,
as may be seen by the popular representation of him (Fig. 27), with
a knight's hand grasping his throat.

A Singhalese demon of like class is Bahirawa, who takes his name
from the hill of the same name, towering over Kandy, in which he
is supposed to reside. The legend runs that the astrologers told
a king whose queen was afflicted by successive miscarriages, that
she would never be delivered of a healthy child unless a virgin was
sacrificed annually on the top of this hill. This being done, several
children were borne to him. When his queen was advanced in years the
king discontinued this observance, and consequently many diseases
fell upon the royal family and the city, after which the annual
sacrifice was resumed, and continued until 1815, when the English
occupied Kandy. The method of the sacrifice was to bind a young girl
to a stake on the top of the hill with jungle-creepers. Beside her,
on an altar, were placed boiled rice and flowers; incantations were
uttered, and the girl left, to be generally found dead of fright in the
morning. An old woman, who in early years had undergone this ordeal,
survived, and her safety no doubt co-operated with English authority
to diminish the popular fear of Bahirawa, but still few natives would
be found courageous enough to ascend the hill at night.

One of the lustful demons of Ceylon is Calu Cumara, that is, the Black
Prince. He is supposed to have seven different apparitions,--prince
of fire, of flowers, of groves, of graves, of eye-ointments, of
the smooth body, and of sexuality. The Saga says he was a Buddhist
priest, who by exceeding asceticism and accumulated merits had gained
the power to fly, but passion for a beautiful woman caused him to
fall. By disappointment in the love for which he had parted with so
much his heart was broken, and he became a demon. In this condition
he is for ever tortured by the passion of lustful desire, the only
satisfaction of which he can obtain being to afflict young and fair
women with illness. He is a very dainty demon, and can be soothed if
great care is taken in the offerings made to him, which consist of
rice of finest quality, plantains, sugar-cane, oranges, cocoa-nuts,
and cakes. He is of dark-blue complexion and his raiment black.

In Singhalese demonolatry there are seven female demons of lust,
popularly called the Madana Yaksenyo. These sisters are--Cama (lust);
Cini (fire); Mohanee (ignorance); Rutti (pleasure); Cala (maturity);
Mal (flowers); Puspa (perfumes). They are the abettors of seduction,
and are invoked in the preparation of philtres. [201]

'It were well,' said Jason to Medea, 'that the female race should
not exist; then would there not have been any evil among men.' [202]
The same sentiment is in Milton--


                      Oh why did God,
        Creator wise, that peopled highest heaven
        With spirits masculine, create at last
        This novelty on earth, this fair defect
        Of nature, and not fill the world at once
        With men, as angels, without feminine? [203]


Many traditions preceded this ungallant creed, some of which have
been referred to in our chapters on Lilith and Eve. Corresponding
to these are the stories related by Herodotus of the overthrow of
the kingdom of the Heraclidae and freedom of the Greeks, through
the revenge of the Queen, 'the most beautiful of women,' upon her
husband Candaules for having contrived that Gyges should see her
naked. Candaules having been slain by Gyges at the instigation of the
Queen, and married her, the Fates decreed that their crime should be
punished on their fifth descendant. The overthrow was by Cyrus, and
it was associated with another woman, Mandane, daughter of the tyrant
Astyages, mother of Cyrus, who is thus, as the Madonna, to bruise
the head of the serpent who had crept into the Greek Paradise. [204]
The Greeks of Pontus also ascribed the origin of the Scythian race,
the scourge of all nations, to a serpent-woman, who, having stolen
away the mares which Herakles had captured from Gergon, refused to
restore them except on condition of having children by him. From the
union of Herakles with this 'half virgin, half viper,' sprang three
sons, of whom the youngest was Scythes.

Not only are feminine seductiveness and liability to seduction
represented in the legends of female demons and devils, but quite as
much the jealousy of that sex. If the former were weaknesses which
might overthrow kingdoms, the latter was a species of animalism which
could devastate the home and society. Although jealousy is sometimes
regarded as venial, if not indeed a sign of true love, it is an outcome
of the animal nature. The Japanese have shown a true observation of
nature in portraying their female Oni (devil) of jealousy (Fig. 28)
with sharp erect horns and bristling hair. The raising 'of the
ornamental plumes by many birds during their courtship,' mentioned
by Mr. Darwin, is the more pleasing aspect of that emotion which,
blending with fear and rage, puffs out the lizard's throat, ruffles
the cock's neck, and raises the hair of the insane. [205]

An ancient legend mingles jealousy with the myth of Eden at every
step. Rabbi Jarchi says that the serpent was jealous of Adam's
connubial felicity, and a passage in Josephus shows that this was an
ancient opinion. The jealousy of Adam's second wife felt by his first
(Lilith) was by many said to be the cause of her conspiracy with
the serpent. The most beautiful mediaeval picture of her that I have
seen was in an illuminated Bible in Strasburg, in which, with all
her wealth of golden hair and her beauty, Lilith holds her mouth,
with a small rosy apple in it, towards Adam. Eve seems to snatch
it. Then there is an old story that when Eve had eaten the apple
she saw the [[angel]] of death, and urged Adam to eat the fruit also,
in order that he might not become a widower.

It is remarkable that there should have sprung up a legend that Satan
made his second attack upon the race formed by Jehovah, and his plan
for perpetuating it on earth by means of a flirtation with Noah's
wife, and also by awakening her jealousy. The older legend concerning
Noah's wife is that mentioned by Tabari, which merely states that she
ridiculed the predictions of a deluge by her husband. So much might
have been suggested by the silence of the Bible concerning her. The
Moslem tradition that the Devil managed to get into the ark is also
ancient. He caught hold of the ass's tail just as it was about to
enter. The ass came on slowly, and Noah, becoming impatient, exclaimed,
'You cursed one, come in quick!' When Noah, seeing the Devil in the
ark, asked by what right he was there, the other said, 'By your order;
you said, "Accursed one, come in;" I am the accursed one!' This story,
which seems contrived to show that one may not be such an ass as he
looks, was superseded by the legend which represents Satan as having
been brought into the ark concealed under Noria's (or Noraita's) dress.

The most remarkable legend of this kind is that found in the Eastern
Church, and which is shown in various mediaeval designs in Russia. Satan
is shown, in an early sixteenth century picture belonging to Count
Uvarof (Fig. 29), offering Noah's wife a bunch of khmel (hops) with
which to brew kvas and make Noah drunk; for the story was that Noah
did not tell his wife that a deluge was coming, knowing that she
could not keep a secret. In the old version of the legend given by
Buslaef, 'after apocryphal tradition used by heretics,' Satan always
addresses Noah's wife as Eve, which indicates a theory. It was meant
to be considered as a second edition of the attack on the divine
plan begun in Eden, and revived in the temptation of Sara. Satan not
only taught this new Eve how to make kvas but also vodka (brandy);
and when he had awakened her jealousy about Noah's frequent absence,
he bade her substitute the brandy for the beer when her husband,
as usual, asked for the latter. When Noah was thus in his cups she
asked him where he went, and why he kept late hours. He revealed his
secret to his Eve, who disclosed it to Satan. The tempter appears
to have seduced her from Noah, and persuaded her to be dilatory when
entering the ark. When all the animals had gone in, and all the rest
of her family, Eve said, 'I have forgotten my pots and pans,' and went
to fetch them; next she said, 'I have forgotten my spoons and forks,'
and returned for them. All of this had been arranged by Satan in order
to make Noah curse; and he had just slipped under Eve's skirt when he
had the satisfaction of hearing the intended Adam of a baptized world
cry to his wife, 'Accursed one, come in!' Since Jehovah himself could
not prevent the carrying out of a patriarch's curse, Satan was thus
enabled to enter the ark, save himself from being drowned, and bring
mischief into the human world once more.

This is substantially the same legend as that of the mediaeval Morality
called 'Noah's Ark, or the Shipwright's Ancient Play or Dirge.' The
Devil says to Noah's wife:--


            Yes, hold thee still le dame,
            And I shall tell thee how;
            I swear thee by my crooked snout,
            All that thy husband goes about
            Is little to thy profit.
            Yet shall I tell thee how
            Thou shalt meet all his will;
            Do as I shall bid thee now,
            Thou shalt meet every deal.
            Have here a drink full good
            That is made of a mightful main,
            Be he hath drunken a drink of this,
            No longer shall he learn:
            Believe, believe, my own dear dame,
            I may no longer bide;
            To ship when thou shalt sayre,
            I shall be by thy side.


There are some intimations in the Slavonic version which look as if
it might have belonged to some Paulician or other half-gnostic theory
that the temptation of Noraita (Eve II.), and her alienation from
her husband, were meant to prevent the repopulation of the Earth. [206]

The next attempt of the Devil, as agent of the Elohistic creation,
to ruin the race of man, introduces us to another form of animalism
which has had a large expression in Devil-lore. It is related in
rabbinical mythology that when, as is recorded in Gen. ix. 20, Noah
was planting a vineyard, the Devil (Asmodeus) came and proposed to
join him in the work. This having been agreed to, this evil partner
brought in succession a sheep, a lion, and a hog, and sacrificed
them on the spot. The result was that the wine when drunk first gave
the drinker the quality of a sheep, then that of a lion, and finally
that of a hog. [207] It was by this means that Noah was reduced to
swinish inebriation. There followed the curses on those around him,
which, however drunken, were those of a father, and reproduced on
the cleansed world all the dooms which had been pronounced in Eden.

If the date of this legend could be made early enough, it would appear
to be a sort of revenge for this temptation of Noah to drunkenness
that Talmudic fable shows Asmodeus brought under bondage to Solomon,
and forced to work on the Temple, by means of wine. Asmodeus had
dug for himself a well, and planted beside it a tree, so making for
himself a pleasant spot for repose during his goings to and fro on
earth. But Solomon's messenger Benaja managed to cover this with a
tank which he filled with wine. Asmodeus, on his return, repeated
to himself the proverb, 'Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging,
and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise' (Prov. xx. 1); yet,
being very thirsty, he drank, fell asleep, and when he awoke found
himself loaded with chains.

However, after working for a time for Solomon, he discovered that
king's weaknesses and played upon them. Solomon was so puffed up with
a sense of his power that he accepted a challenge from his slave
(Asmodeus) to show his superiority without the assistance of his
magic ring, and without keeping his competitor in bonds. No sooner
was Asmodeus free, and in possession of the ring, than he transported
Solomon four hundred miles away, where he remained for a long time
among the seductive beauties of the Courts of Naamah, Rahab, and
other she-devils. Meanwhile the Devil, assuming the form of Solomon,
sat on his throne, and became the darling of his Queen and concubines.

The Devil of Wine and strong drink generally has a wide representation
in folklore. We find him in the bibulous Serpent of Japan, who first
loses his eight heads metaphorically, and then literally from the first
of Swords-men. The performances of Mephistopheles in Auerbach's Cellar
are commemorated in its old frescoes, and its motto: 'Live, drink,
carouse, remembering Faust and his punishment: it came slowly, but was
in ample measure.' Thuringian legends relate that the Devil tries to
stop the building of churches by casting down the stones, but this may
be stopped by the builders promising to erect a winehouse in the same
neighbourhood. An old English legend relates that a great man's cellar
was haunted by devils who drank up his wine. On one occasion a barrel
was marked with holy water, and the devil was found stuck fast on it.

Gluttony, both in eating and drinking, has had its many
personifications. The characteristics of the Hunger demons are
travestied in such devils as these, only the diabolical, as
distinguished from the demonic element, appears in features of
luxuriousness. The contrast between the starveling saints of the
early Church and the well-fed friars of later times was a frequent
subject of caricature, as in the accompanying example (Fig. 30) from
the British Museum, fourteenth century (MS. Arundel), where a lean
devil is satisfying himself through a fattened friar. One of the most
significant features of the old legend of Faust is the persistence of
the animal character in which Mephistopheles appears. He is an ugly
dog--a fit emblem of the scholar's relapse into the canine temper which
flies at the world as at a bone he means to gnaw. Faust does not like
this genuine form, and bids the Devil change it. Mephistopheles then
takes the form of a Franciscan friar; but 'the kernel of the brute'
is in him still, and he at once loads Faust's table with luxuries and
wines from the cellars of the Archbishop of Salzburg and other rich
priests. The prelates are fond of their bone too. When Mephistopheles
and Faust find their way into the Vatican, it is to witness carousals
of the Pope and his Cardinals. They snatch from them their luxuries and
wine-goblets as they are about to enjoy them. Against these invisible
invaders the holy men bring their crucifixes and other powers of
exorcism; and it is all snarling and growling--canine priest against
puppy astrologer. Nor was it very different in the history of the
long contention between the two for the big bone of Christendom.

The lust of Gold had its devils, and they were not different from
other types of animalism. This was especially the case with such
as represented money, extorted from the people to supply wealth to
dissolute princes and prelates. The giants of Antwerp represent the
power of the pagan monarchs who exacted tribute; but these were
replaced by such guardians of tribute-money as the Satyr of our
picture (Fig. 31), which Edward the Confessor saw seated on a barrel
of Danegeld,


                Vit un deable saer desus
                Le tresor, noir et hidus.


There are many good fables in European folklore with regard to the
miser's gold, and 'devil's money' generally, which exhibit a fine
instinct. A man carries home a package of such gold, and on opening it
there drop out, instead of money, paws and nails of cats, frogs, and
bears--the latter being an almost personal allusion to the Exchange. A
French miser's money-safe being opened, two frogs only were found. The
Devil could not get any other soul than the gold, and the cold-blooded
reptiles were left as a sign of the life that had been lived.

In the legends of the swarms of devils which beset St. Anthony we
find them represented as genuine animals. Our Anglo-Saxon fathers,
however, were quite unable to appreciate the severity of the conflict
which man had to wage with the animal world in Southern countries and
in earlier times. Nor had their reverence for nature and its forms
been crushed out by the pessimist theory of the earth maintained by
Christianity. Gradually the representation of the animal tempters was
modified, and instead of real animal forms there were reported the
bearded bestialities which surrounded St. Guthlac and St. Godric. The
accompanying picture (Fig. 32) is a group from Breughel (1565),
representing the devils called around St. James by a magician. These
grotesque forms will repay study. If we should make a sketch of the
same kind, only surrounding the saint with the real animal shapes
most nearly resembling these nondescripts, it would cease to be a
diabolical scene.

For beastliness is not a character of beasts; it is the arrest of
man. It is not the picturesque donkey in the meadow that is ridiculous,
but the donkey on two feet; not the bear of zoological gardens that
is offensive morally, but the rough, who cannot always be caged; it
is the two-legged calf, the snake pretending to be a man, the ape in
evening dress, who ever made the problem of evil at all formidable. It
was insoluble until men had discovered as Science that law of Evolution
which the ancient world knew as Ethics.

A Hindu fable relates that the animals, in their migration, came to
an abyss they could not cross, and that the gods made man as a bridge
across it. Science and Reason confirm these ancient instincts of our
race. Man is that bridge stretching between the animal and the ideal
habitat by which, if the development be normal, all the passions pass
upward into educated powers. Any pause or impediment on that bridge
brings all the animals together to rend and tear the man who cannot
convey them across the abyss. A very slight arrest may reveal to a
man that he is a vehicle of intensified animalism. The lust of the
goat, the pride of the peacock, the wrath of the lion, beautiful in
their appropriate forms, become, in the guise of a man uncontrolled
by reason, the vices which used to be called possession, and really
are insanities.







CHAPTER XXIX.

THOUGHTS AND INTERPRETATIONS.


I lately heard the story of a pious negro woman whose faith in hell
was sorely tried by a sceptic who asked her how brimstone enough could
be found to burn all the wicked people in the world. After taking
some days for reflection, the old woman, when next challenged by the
sceptic, replied, that she had concluded that 'every man took his
own brimstone.' This humble saint was unconscious that her instinct
had reached the finest thought of Milton, whose Satan says 'Myself am
hell.' Marlowe's Mephistopheles also says, 'Where we are is hell.' And,
far back as the year 633, the holy man Fursey, who believed himself to
have been guided by an [[angel]] near the region of the damned, related
a vision much like the view of the African woman. There were four
fires--Falsehood, Covetousness, Discord, Injustice--which joined to
form one great flame. When this drew near, Fursey, in fear, said,
'Lord, behold the fire draws near me.' The [[angel]] answered, 'That
which you did not kindle shall not burn you.'

Such association of any principle of justice, even in form so crude,
has become rare enough in Christendom to excite applause when it
appears, though the applause has about it that infusion of the
grotesque which one perceives when gallery-gods cheer the actor who
heroically declares that a man ought not to strike a woman. When we
go back to the atmosphere of Paganism we find that retribution had
among them a real meaning. Nothing can be in more remarkable contrast
than the disorderly characterless hell of Christendom, into which the
murderer and the man who confuses the Persons of the Godhead alike
burn everlastingly in most inappropriate fires, and the Hades of Egypt,
Greece, and Rome, where every punishment bears relation to the offence,
and is limited in duration to the degree of the offence.

'The Egyptians,' says Herodotus (ii. 123), 'were the first who asserted
that the soul of man is immortal, and that when the body perishes it
enters into some other animal, constantly springing into existence; and
when it has passed through the different kinds of terrestrial, marine,
and aerial beings, it again enters into the body of a man that is born,
and that this revolution is made in three thousand years.' Probably
Plato imported from Egypt his fancy of the return of one dead to
relate the scenes of heaven and hell, Er the Armenian (Republic,
x. 614) suggesting an evolution of Rhampsinitus (Herod. ii. 122),
who descended to Hades alive, played dice with Ceres, and brought
back gold. The vision of Er represents a terrible hell, indeed, but
those punished were chiefly murderers and tyrants. They are punished
tenfold for every wrong they had committed. But when this punishment
is ended, each soul must return to the earth in such animal form
as he or she might select. The animals, too, had their choice. Er
saw that the choice was generally determined by the previous earthly
life,--many becoming animals because of some spite derived from their
experience. 'And not only did men pass into animals, but I must also
mention that there were animals tame and wild who changed into one
another, and into corresponding human natures, the good into the
gentle, the evil into the savage, in all sorts of combinations.' Sly
Plato! Such is his estimate of what men's selections of their paradises
are worth!

Orpheus chose to be a swan, hating to be born of woman, because women
murdered him; Ajax became a lion and Agamemnon an eagle, because
they had suffered injustice from men; Atalanta would be an athlete,
and the jester Thersites a monkey; and Odysseus went about to find
the life of a private gentleman with nothing to do. If Plutarch's
friend Thespesius had pondered well this irony of Plato, he would
hardly have brought back from his visit to Hades the modification
that demons were provided to assign the animal forms in which souls
should be born again on earth. They could hardly have done for the
wicked anything worse than Plato shows them doing for themselves. But
the meaning of Plutarch is the same. Thespesius sees demons preparing
the body of a viper for Nero to be born into, since it was said the
young of that reptile destroy their mother at birth.



Among the Persians the idea of future rewards and punishments exceeds
the exactness of the Koran--'Whoso hath done an atom of justice shall
behold it, and whoso hath done an atom of injustice shall behold
it.' The Persian Sufis will even subdivide the soul rather than that
any good act should go down with the larger gross of wickedness. Sadi
tells of a vision where a man was seen in hell, all except one foot,
which was twined with flowers. With all his wickedness the man had
with that foot shoved a bundle of hay within reach of a weary ox.

But while Persian poets--Sufis, ennobling the old name
Sophist--preserved thus a good deal of the universalism of Parsaism,
a Mohammedanism hard as the Scythians who brought it turned the heart
of the people in that country to stone. In the Dresden Library there
is an illuminated Persian MS., thought to be seven hundred years
old, which has in it what may be regarded as a portrait of Ahriman
and Iblis combined. He is red, has a heavy beard and moustache, and
there is a long dragon's crest and mane on his head. He wears a green
and blue skirt about his loins. His tongue rolls thirstily between
his cruel teeth. He superintends a number of fish-like devils which
float in a lake of fire, and swallow the damned. Above this scene
are the glorified souls, including the Shah sitting cross-legged
on his rug, who look down on the tortures beneath with evident
satisfaction. Apparently this is the only amusement which relieves
the ennui of their heaven.

If anything could make a rational man believe in a fiend-principle
in the universe it would be the suggestion of such pictures,
that men have existed who could conceive of happiness enjoyed in
view of such tortures as these. This and some similar pictures in
the East--for instance, that in the Temple of Horrors at Wuchang,
China--are absolutely rayless so far as any touch of humanity is
concerned. Are the Shah and his happy fellow-inspectors of tortures
really fiends? In the light of our present intelligence they may seem
so. Certainly no person of refined feeling could now expect to attain
any heaven while others were in hell. But it would be possible, if
persons could believe that many of those around them are not men and
women at all, but fiends in human shape. These ferocious Hells are
referable to a period when all who incurred the sentences of princes
or priests were seen as mere masks of devils; they were only ascribed
human flesh that they may suffer. The dogma of Hell was doomed from
the moment that the damned were supposed to be really human.

Were those who killed the martyrs of heresy, for instance, to return
to the world and look upon those whom they pierced, they could never
recognise them. Were they to see the statues of Bruno, Huss, Cranmer,
Servetus, the names and forms would not recall to them the persons
they slew. They would be shocked if told that they had burned great
men, and would surely answer, 'Men? We burned no men. The Devil came
among us calling himself Huss, and we made short work with him; he
reappeared under several aliases--Bruno, Servetus, Spinoza, Voltaire:
sometimes we burned him, at other times managed to make him miserable,
thank God! But we were not hurting real men, we were saving them.'

Around such ideas grew our yet uncivilised Codes of Law. In England,
anno 1878, men are refused as jury-men if they will not say, 'So help
me God!' on the ground that an atheist cannot have a conscience. Only
let him really be without conscience, and call himself a christian when
he is not, and courts receive the selfish liar with respect. The old
clause of the death-sentence--'instigated thereto by the Devil'--has
been dropped in the case of murderers, however; and that is some
gain. Torture by fire of the worst murderer for one day would not
be permitted in Christendom. Belief in hell-fire outlasts it for a
little among the ignorant. But what shall be said of the educated
who profess to believe it?



The Venerable Bede relates that, in the year 696, a Northumbrian
gentleman, who had died in the beginning of the night, came to life
and health in the morning, and gave an account of what he had seen
overnight. He had witnessed the conventional tortures of the damned,
but adds--'Being thus on all sides enclosed with enemies and darkness,
and looking about on every side for assistance, there appeared to me,
on the way that I came, as it were, the brightness of a star shining
amidst the darkness, which increased by degrees,'--but we need not
go on to the anti-climax of this vision.

This star rising above all such visions belongs to the vault of the
human Love, and it is visible through all the Ages of Darkness. It
cannot be quenched, and its fiery rays have burnt up mountains of
iniquity.

'In the year 1322,' writes Flogel, after the 'Chronicon Sampetrinum
Erfurtense,' 'there was a play shown at Eisenach, which had a
tragical enough effect. Markgraf Friedrich of Misnia, Landgraf also
of Thuringia, having brought his tedious warfare to a conclusion,
and the country beginning now to revive under peace, his subjects
were busy repaying themselves for the past distresses by all manner
of diversions; to which end, apparently by the Sovereign's order,
a dramatic representation of the Ten Virgins was schemed, and at
Eisenach, in his presence, duly executed. This happened fifteen days
after Easter, by indulgence of the Preaching Friars. In the 'Chronicon
Sampetrinum' stands recorded that the play was enacted in the Bear
Garden (in horto ferarum) by the Clergy and their Scholars. But now,
when it came to pass that the Wise Virgins would give the foolish no
oil, and these latter were shut out from the Bridegroom, they began
to weep bitterly, and called on the Saints to intercede for them;
who however, even with Mary at their head, could effect nothing from
God; but the Foolish Virgins were all sentenced to damnation. Which
things the Landgraf seeing and hearing, he fell into a doubt,
and was very angry; and said 'What then is the Christian Faith,
if God will not take pity on us for intercession of Mary and all
the Saints?' In this anger he continued five days; and the learned
men could hardly enlighten him to understand the Gospel. Thereupon
he was struck with apoplexy, and became speechless and powerless;
in which sad state he continued, bedrid, two years and seven months,
and so died, being then fifty-five.'

In telling the story Carlyle remarks that these 'Ten Virgins at
Eisenach are more fatal to warlike men than Aeschylus' Furies at
Athens were to weak women.' Even so, until great-hearted men rose up
at Eisenach and elsewhere to begin the work destined to prove fatal
alike to heartless Virgins and Furies. That star of a warrior's
Compassion, hovering over the foolish Friars and their midnight
Gospel, beams far. The story reminds me of an incident related of
a mining district in California, where a rude theatre was erected,
and a company gave, as their first performance, Othello. When the
scene of Desdemona's suffocation approached, a stalwart miner leaped
on the stage, and pulling out his six-shooter, said to the Moor,
'You damned nigger! if you touch that woman I'll blow the top of your
head off!' A dozen roughs, clambering over the footlights, cried,
'Right Joe! we'll stand by you!' The manager met the emergency by
crying, 'Don't shoot, boys! This play was wrote by Bill Shakespear;
he's an old Californian, and it's all in fun!' Had this Moor proceeded
to roast Desdemona in fire with any verisimilitude, it is doubtful
if the manager could have saved him by an argument reminding the
miners that such was the divine way with sinners in the region to
which most of them were going. The top of that theologic hell's head
is not very safe in these days when human nature is unchained with
all its six-shooters, each liable to be touched off by fire from that
Star revolving in the sphere of Compassion.



Day after day I gazed upon Michael Angelo's 'Last Judgment' in the
Sistine Chapel. The artist was in his sixtieth year when Pope Clement
VII. invited him to cover a wall sixty feet high and nearly as wide
with a picture of the Day of Wrath. In seven years he had finished
it. Clement was dead. Pope Paul IV. looked at it, and liked it not:
all he could see was a vast number of naked figures; so he said it
was not fit for the Sistine Chapel, and must be destroyed. One of
Michael Angelo's pupils saved it by draping some of the figures. Time
went on, and another Pope came who insisted on more drapery,--so the
work was disfigured again. However, popular ridicule saved this from
going very far, and so there remains the tremendous scene. But Popes
and Cardinals always disliked it. The first impression I received
from it was that of a complete representation of all the physical
powers belonging to organised life; though the forms are human, every
animal power is there, leaping, crouching, crawling,--every sinew,
joint, muscle, portrayed in completest tension and action. Then the
eye wanders from face to face, and every passion that ever crawled or
prowled in jungle or swamp is pictured. The most unpleasant expressions
seemed to me those of the martyrs. They came up from their graves,
each bringing the instrument by which he had suffered, and offering
it in witness against the poor wretches who came to be judged; and
there was a look of self-righteous satisfaction on their faces as
they witnessed the persecution of their persecutors. As for Christ,
he was like a fury, with hand uplifted against the doomed, his hair
wildly floating. The tortured people below are not in contrast with
the blessed above; they who are in heaven look rather more stupid
than the others, and rather pleased with the anguish they witness,
but not more saintly. But gradually the eye, having wandered over
the vast canvas, from the tortured Cardinal at the bottom up to the
furious Judge,--alights on a face which, once seen, is never to be
forgotten. Beautiful she is, that Mary beside the Judge, and more
beautiful for the pain that is on her face. She has drawn her drapery
to veil from her sight the anguish below; she has turned her face
from the Judge,--does not see her son in him; she looks not upon the
blessed,--for she, the gentle mother, is not in heaven; she cannot have
joy in sight of misery. In that one face of pure womanly sympathy--that
beauty transfigured in its compassionateness--the artist put his soul,
his religion. Mary's face quenches all the painted flames. They are at
once made impossible. The same universe could not produce both a hell
and that horror of it. The furious Jesus is changed to a phantasm;
he could never be born of such a mother. If the Popes had only wished
to hide the nakedness of their own dogmas they ought to have blotted
out Mary's face; for as it now stands the rest of the forms are but
shapes to show how all the wild forms and passions of human animalism
gather as a frame round that which is their consummate flower,--the
spirit of love enshrined in its perfect human expression.

So was it that Michael Angelo could not serve two masters. Popes might
employ him, but he could not do the work they liked. 'The passive
master lent his hand to the vast soul that o'er him planned.' He
could not help it. The lover of beauty could not paint the Day of
Wrath without setting above it that face like a star which shines
through its unreality, burns up its ugliness, and leaves the picture
a magnificent interpretation of the forms of nature and hopes of the
world,--a cardinal hypocrite at the bottom, an ideal woman at the top.



Exhausted by the too-much glory of the visions of Paradise which he had
seen, Dante came forth to the threshold opening on the world of human
life, from which he had parted for a space, and there sank down. As
he lay there angels caused lilies to grow beneath and around him,
and myrtle to rise and intertwine for a bower over him, and their
happy voices, wafted in low-toned hymns, brought soft sleep to his
overwrought senses. Long had he slumbered before the light of familiar
day stole once more into those deep eyes. The angels had departed. The
poet awoke to find himself alone, and with a sigh he said to himself,
'It is, then, all but a dream.' As he arose he saw before him a man
of noble mien and shining countenance, habited in an Eastern robe,
who returned his gaze with an interest equal to his own. Quickly the
eyes of Dante searched the ground beside the stranger to see if he
were shadowless: convinced thus that he was true flesh and blood,
the Florentine thus addressed him:--

'Pilgrim, for such thou seemest, may we meet in simple human
brotherhood? If, as thy garb suggests, thou comest from afar, perchance
the friendly greeting, even of one who in his native city is still
himself a pilgrim, may not be unwelcome.

'Heart to heart be our kiss, my brother; yet must I journey without
delay to those who watch and wait for wondrous tidings that I bear.

'Friend! I hear some meaning deeper than thy words. If 'twere but as
satisfying natural curiosity, answer not; but if thou bearest a burden
of tidings glad for all human-kind, speak! Who art thou? whence comest,
and with what message freighted?

'Arda Viraf is the name I bear; from Persia have I come; but by what
strange paths have reached this spot know I not, save that through
splendours of worlds invisible to mortal sense I have journeyed,
nor encountered human form till I found thee slumbering on this spot.

'Trebly then art thou my brother! I too have but now, as to my confused
sense it seems, emerged from that vast journey. Thou clearest from
me gathering doubts that those visions were illusive. Yet, as even
things we really see are often overlaid by images that lurk in the
eye, I pray thee tell me something thou hast seen, so that perchance
we may part with mutual confirmation of our vision.

'That gladly will I do. When the Avesta had been destroyed, and the
sages of Iran disagreed as to the true religion, they agreed that
one should be chosen by lot to drink the sacred draught of Vishtasp,
that he might pass to the invisible world and bring intelligence
therefrom. On me the lot fell. Beside the fire that has never gone
out, surrounded by holy women who chanted our hymns, I drank the three
cups--Well Thought, Well Said, Well Done. Then as I slept there rose
before me a high stairway of three steps; on the first was written,
Well Thought; on the second, Well Said; on the third, Well Done. By
the first step I reached the realm where good thoughts are honoured:
there were the thinkers whose starlike radiance ever increased. They
offered no prayers, they chanted no liturgies. Above all was the
sphere of the liberal. The next step brought me to the circle of
great and truthful speakers: these walked in lofty splendour. The
third step brought me to the heaven of good actions. I saw the souls
of agriculturists surrounded by spirits of water and earth, trees and
cattle. The artisans were seated on embellished thrones. Sublime were
the seats of teachers, interceders, peace-makers; and the religious
walked in light and joy with which none are satiated.

'Sawest thou the fairest of earth-born ladies--Beatrice?

'I saw indeed a lady most fair. In a pleasant grove lay the form
of a man who had but then parted from earth. When he had awakened,
he walked through the grove and there met him this most beautiful
maiden. To her he said, 'Who art thou, so fair beyond all whom I
have seen in the land of the living?' To him she replied, 'O youth,
I am thy actions.' Can this be thy lady Beatrice?

'But sawest thou no hell? no dire punishments?

'Alas! sad scenes I witnessed, sufferers whose hell was that their
darkness was amid the abodes of splendour. Amid all that glow one newly
risen from earth walked shivering with cold, and there walked ever
by his side a hideous hag. On her he turned and said, 'Who art thou,
that ever movest beside me, thou that art monstrous beyond all that
I have seen on earth?' To him she replied, 'Man, I am thy actions.'

'But who were those glorious ones thou sawest in Paradise?

'Some of their names I did indeed learn--Zoroaster, Socrates, Plato,
Buddha, Confucius, Christ.

'What do I hear! knowest thou that none of these save that last
holy one--whom methinks thou namest too lightly among men--were
baptized? Those have these eyes sorrowfully beheld in pain through
the mysterious justice of God.

'Thinkest thou, then, thy own compassion deeper than the mercy of
Ormuzd? But, ah! now indeed I do remember. As I conversed with the
sages I had named, they related to me this strange event. By guidance
of one of their number, Virgil by name, there had come among them
from the earth a most powerful magician. He bore the name of Dante. By
mighty spells this being had cast them all into a sad circle which he
called Limbo, over whose gate he wrote, though with eyes full of tears,
'All hope abandon, ye who enter here!' Thus were they in great sorrow
and dismay. But, presently, as this strange Dante was about to pass
on, so they related, he looked upon the face of one among them so pure
and noble that though he had styled him 'pagan,' he could not bear to
abandon him there. This was Cato of Utica. Him this Dante led to the
door, and gave him liberty on condition that he would be warder of his
unbaptized brethren, and by no means let any of them escape. No sooner,
however, was this done than this magician beheld others who moved
his reverence,--among them Trajan and Ripheus,--and overcome by an
impulse of love, he opened a window in the side of Limbo, bidding them
emerge into light. He then waved his christian wand to close up this
aperture, and passed away, supposing that he had done so; but the limit
of that magician's power had been reached, the window was but veiled,
and after he had gone all these unbaptized ones passed out by that
way, and reascended to the glory they had enjoyed before this Dante
had brought his alien sorceries to bear upon them for a brief space.

'Can this be true? Is it indeed so that all the sages and poets of
the world are now in equal rank whether or not they have been sealed
as members of Christ?

'Brother, thy brow is overcast. What! can one so pure and high of
nature as thou desire that the gentle Christ, whom I saw embracing
the sages and prophets of other ages, should turn upon them with
hatred and bind them in gloom and pain like this Dante?'

Thereupon, with a flood of tears, Dante fell at the feet of Arda Viraf,
and kissed the hem of his skirt. 'Purer is thy vision, O pilgrim,
than mine,' he said. 'I fear that I have but borne with me to the
invisible world the small prejudices of my little Church, which hath
taught me to limit the Love which I now see to be boundless. Thou who
hast learned from thy Zoroaster that the meaning of God is the end of
all evil, a universe climbing to its flower in joy, deign to take the
hand of thy servant and make him worthy to be thy friend,--with thee
henceforth to abandon the poor formulas which ignorance substitutes
for virtue, and ascend to the beautiful summits thou has visited by
the stairway of good thoughts, good words, good deeds.'



In 1745 Swedenborg was a student of Natural Philosophy in London. In
the April of that year his 'revelations' began amid the smoke
and toil of the great metropolis. 'I was hungry and ate with great
appetite. Towards the end of the meal I remarked a kind of mist spread
before my eyes, and I saw the floor of my room covered with hideous
reptiles, such as serpents, toads, and the like. I was astonished,
having all my wits about me, being perfectly conscious. The darkness
attained its height and then passed away. I now saw a Man sitting
in the corner of the chamber. As I had thought myself alone, I was
greatly frightened when he said to me, 'Eat not as much.'

In Swedenborg's Diary the incident is related more particularly. 'In
the middle of the day, at dinner, an [[Angel]] spoke to me, and told me
not to eat too much at table. Whilst he was with me, there plainly
appeared to me a kind of vapour steaming from the pores of my body. It
was a most visible watery vapour, and fell downwards to the ground
upon the carpet, where it collected and turned into divers vermin,
which were gathered together under the table, and in a moment went
off with a pop or noise. A fiery light appeared within them, and a
sound was heard, pronouncing that all the vermin that could possibly
be generated by unseemly appetite were thus cast out of my body,
and burnt up, and that I was now cleansed from them. Hence we may
know what luxury and the like have for their bosom contents.'

Continuing the first account Swedenborg said, 'The following
night the same Man appeared to me again. I was this time not at
all alarmed. The Man said, 'I am God, the Lord, the Creator, and
Redeemer of the world. I have chosen thee to unfold to men the
spiritual sense of the Holy Scripture. I will myself dictate to
thee what thou shalt write.' The same night the world of spirits,
hell and heaven, were convincingly opened to me, where I found many
persons of my acquaintance of all conditions. From that day forth I
gave up all worldly learning, and laboured only in spiritual things,
according to what the Lord commanded me to write.'

He 'gave up all worldly learning,' shut his intellectual eyes,
and sank under all the nightmares which his first vision saw burnt
up as vermin. After his fiftieth year, says Emerson, he falls into
jealousy of his intellect, makes war on it, and the violence is
instantly avenged. But the portrait of the blinded mystic as drawn
by the clear seer is too impressive an illustration to be omitted here.

'A vampyre sits in the seat of the prophet and turns with gloomy
appetite to the images of pain. Indeed, a bird does not more readily
weave its nest or a mole bore in the ground than this seer of the
souls substructs a new hell and pit, each more abominable than the
last, round every new crew of offenders. He was let down through a
column that seemed of brass, but it was formed of angelic spirits,
that he might descend safely amongst the unhappy, and witness
the vastation of souls; and heard there, for a long continuance,
their lamentations; he saw their tormentors, who increase and strain
pangs to infinity; he saw the hell of the jugglers, the hell of the
assassins, the hell of the lascivious; the hell of robbers, who kill
and boil men; the infernal tun of the deceitful; the excrementitious
hells; the hell of the revengful, whose faces resembled a round,
broad cake, and their arms rotate like a wheel.... The universe, in
his poem, suffers under a magnetic sleep, and only reflects the mind
of the magnetiser.... Swedenborg and Behmon both failed by attaching
themselves to the christian symbol, instead of to the moral sentiment,
which carries innumerable christianities, humanities, divinities, in
its bosom.... Another dogma, growing out of this pernicious theologic
limitation, is this Inferno. Swedenborg has devils. Evil, according
to old philosophers, is good in the making. That pure malignity can
exist, is the extreme proposition of unbelief.... To what a painful
perversion had Gothic theology arrived, that Swedenborg admitted no
conversion for evil spirits! But the divine effort is never relaxed;
the carrion in the sun will convert itself to grass and flowers;
and man, though in brothels, or jails, or on gibbets, is on his way
to all that is good and true.'

But even the Hell of Swedenborg is not free from the soft potency
of our star. It is almost painful, indeed, to see its spiritual
ray mingling with the fiery fever-shapes which Swedenborg meets
on his way through the column of brass,--made, had he known it,
not of angels but of savage scriptures. 'I gave up all worldly
learning'--he says: but it did not give him up all at once. 'They
(the damned) suffer ineffable torments; but it was permitted to
relieve or console them with a certain degree of hope, so that they
should not entirely despair. For they said they believed the torment
would be eternal. They were relieved or consoled by saying that God
Messiah is merciful, and that in His Word we read that 'the prisoners
will be sent forth from the pit' (Zech. ix. 2). Swedenborg reports
that God Messiah appeared to these spirits, and even embraced and
kissed one who had been raised from 'the greatest torment.' He says,
'Punishment for the sake of punishment is the punishment of a devil,'
and affirms that all punishment is 'to take away evils or to induce a
faculty of doing good.' These utterances are in his Diary, and were
written before he had got to the bottom of his Calvinistic column;
but even in the 'Arcana Celestia' there is a gleam:--'Such is the
equilibrium of all things in another life that evil punishes itself,
and unless it were removed by punishments the evil spirits must
necessarily be kept in some hell to eternity.'

Reductio ad absurdum! And yet Swedenborgians insist upon the dogma of
everlasting punishments; to sustain which they appeal from Swedenborg
half-sober to Swedenborg mentally drunk.



In the Library at Dresden there is a series of old pictures said to be
Mexican, and which I was told had been purchased from a Jew in Vienna,
containing devils mainly of serpent characters blended with those of
humanity. One was a fantastic serpent with human head, sharp snoutish
nose, many eyes, slight wings, and tongue lolling out. Another had a
human head and reptilian tail. A third is human except for the double
tongue darting out. A fourth has issuing from the back of his head a
serpent whose large dragon head is swallowing a human embryo. Whatever
tribe it was that originated these pictures must have had very strong
impressions of the survival of the serpent in some men.

I was reminded of the picture of the serpent swallowing the human
embryo while looking at the wall-pictures in Russian churches
representing the conventional serpent with devils nestling at intervals
along its body, as represented in our Figure (10). Professor Buslaef
gave me the right archaeology of this, no doubt, but the devils
themselves, as I gazed, seemed to intimate another theory with their
fair forms. They might have been winged angels but for their hair
of flame and cruel hooks. They seemed to say, 'We were the ancient
embryo-gods of the human imagination, but the serpent swallowed us. He
swallowed us successively as one after another we availed ourselves
of his cunning in our priesthoods; as we brought his cruel coils to
crush those who dared to outgrow our cult; as we imitated his fang in
the deadliness with which we bit the heel of every advancing thinker;
as, when worsted in our struggle against reason, we took to the double
tongue, praising with one fork the virtues which we poisoned with the
other. Now we are degraded with him for ever, bound to him by these
rings, labelled with the sins we have committed.'



It was by a true experience that the ancients so generally took
nocturnal animals to be types of diabolism. Corresponding to them
are the sleepless activities of morally unawakened men. The animal is
a sleeping man. Its passions and instincts are acted out in what to
rational man would be dreams. In dreams, especially when influenced
by disease, a man may mentally relapse very far, and pass through
kennels and styes, which are such even when somewhat decorated by
shreds of the familiar human environment. The nocturnal form of
intellect is cunning; the obscuration of religion is superstition;
the dark shadow that falls on love turns it to lust. These wolves
and bats, on which no ideal has dawned, do not prowl or flit through
man in their natural forms: in the half-awake consciousness, whose
starlight attends man amid his darkness, their misty outlines swell,
and in the feverish unenlightened conscience they become phantasms of
his animalism--werewolves, vampyres. The awakening of reason in any
animal is through all the phases of cerebral and social evolution. A
wise man said to his son who was afraid to enter the dark, 'Go on,
child; you will never see anything worse than yourself.'



The hare-lip, which we sometimes see in the human face, is there
an arrested development. Every lip is at some embryonic period a
hare-lip. The development of man's visible part has gone on much longer
than his intellectual and moral evolution, and abnormalities in it are
rare in comparison with the number of survivals from the animal world
in his temper, his faith, and his manners. Criminals are men living out
their arrested moral developments. They who regard them as instigated
by a devil are those whose arrest is mental. The eye of reason will
deal with both all the more effectively, because with as little wrath
as a surgeon feels towards the hare-lip he endeavours to humanise.



It is an impressive fact that the great and reverent mind of Spinoza,
in pondering the problem of Evil and the theology which ascribed
it to a Devil, was unconsciously led to anticipate by more than a
century the first (modern) scientific suggestions of the principle
of Evolution. In his early treatise, 'De Deo et Homine,' occurs this
short but momentous chapter--

'De Diabolis. If the Devil be an Entity contrary in all respects to
God, having nothing of God in his nature, there can be nothing in
common with God.

'Is he assumed to be a thinking Entity, as some will have it, who never
wills and never does any good, and who sets himself in opposition to
God on all occasions, he would assuredly be a very wretched being,
and, could prayers do anything for him, his amendment were much to
be implored.

'But let us ask whether so miserable an object could exist even for an
instant; and, the question put, we see at once that it could not; for
from the perfection of a thing proceeds its power of continuance: the
more of the Essential and Divine a thing possesses, the more enduring
it is. But how could the Devil, having no trace of perfection in him,
exist at all? Add to this, that the stability or duration of a thinking
thing depends entirely on its love of and union with God, and that
the opposite of this state in every particular being presumed in the
Devil, it is obviously impossible that there can be any such being.

'And then there is indeed no necessity to presume the existence of a
Devil; for the causes of hate, envy, anger, and all such passions are
readily enough to be discovered; and there is no occasion for resort
to fiction to account for the evils they engender.'

In the course of his correspondence with the most learned men of
his time, Spinoza was severely questioned concerning his views upon
human wickedness, the disobedience of Adam, and so forth. He said--to
abridge his answers--If there be any essential or positive evil in men,
God is the author and continuer of that evil. But what is called evil
in them is their degree of imperfection as compared with those more
perfect. Adam, in the abstract, is a man eating an apple. That is
not in itself an evil action. Acts condemned in man are often admired
in animals,--as the jealousy of doves,--and regarded as evidence of
their perfection. Although man must restrain the forces of nature and
direct them to his purposes, it is a superstition to suppose that God
is angry against such forces. It is an error in man to identify his
little inconveniences as obstacles to God. Let him withdraw himself
from the consideration and nothing is found evil. Whatever exists,
exists by reason of its perfection for its own ends,--which may or
may not be those of men.

Spinoza's aphorism, 'From the perfection of a thing proceeds its power
of continuance,' is the earliest modern statement of the doctrine now
called 'survival of the fittest.' The notion of a Devil involves the
solecism of a being surviving through its unfitness for survival.



Spinoza was Copernicus of the moral Cosmos. The great German who
discovered to men that their little planet was not the one centre and
single care of nature, led the human mind out of a closet and gave
it a universe. But dogma still clung to the closet; where indeed
each sect still remains, holding its little interest to be the aim
of the solar system, and all outside it to be part of a countless
host, marshalled by a Prince of Evil, whose eternal war is waged
against that formidable pulpiteer whose sermon is sending dismay
through pandemonium. But for rational men all that is ended, and its
decline began when Spinoza warned men against looking at the moral
universe from the pin-hole of their egotism. That closet-creation,
whose laws were seen now acting now suspended to suit the affairs of
men, disappeared, and man was led to adore the All.



It is a small thing that man can bruise the serpent's head, if its
fang still carries its venom so deep in his reason as to blacken
all nature with a sense of triumphant malevolence. To the eye of
judicial man, instructed to decide every case without bribe of his
own interest as a rival animal, the serpent's fang is one of the most
perfect adaptations of means to ends in nature. Were a corresponding
perfection in every human mind, the world would fulfil the mystical
dream of the East, which gave one name to the serpents that bit them
in the wilderness and seraphim singing round the eternal throne.



'Cursed be the Hebrew who shall either eat pork, or permit his son to
be instructed in the learning of the Greeks.' So says the Talmud, with
a voice transmitted from the 'kingdom of priests' (Exod. xix. 6). From
the altar of 'unhewn stone' came the curse upon Art, and upon the
race that represented culture raising its tool upon the rudeness
of nature. That curse of the Talmud recoiled fearfully. The Jewish
priesthood had their son in Peter with his vision of clean and unclean
animals, and the command, 'Slay and eat!' Uninstructed is this heir
of priestly Judaism 'in the learning of the Greeks,' consequently
his way of converting Gentiles--the herd of swine, the goyim--is to
convert them into christian protoplasm. 'Slay and eat,' became the
cry of the elect, and their first victim was the paternal Jew who
taught them that pork and Greek learning belonged to the same category.



But there was another Jewish nation not composed of priests. While
the priestly kingdom is typified in Jonah announcing the destruction
of Nineveh, who, because the great city still goes on, reproaches
Jehovah, the nation of the poets has now its Jehovah II. who sees the
humiliation of the tribal priesthood as a withered gourd compared
with the arts, wealth, and human interests of a Gentile city. 'The
Lord repented.' The first Gospel to the Gentiles is in that gentle
thought for the uncircumcised Ninevites. But it was reached too
late. When it gained expression in Christ welcoming Greeks, and seeing
in stones possible 'children of Abraham;' in Paul acknowledging debt
to barbarians and taking his texts from Greek altars or poets; the
evolution of the ideal element in Hebrew religion had gained much. But
historic combinations raised the judaisers to a throne, and all the
narrowness of their priesthood was re-enacted as Christianity.



The column of brass in whose hollow centre the fine brain of Swedenborg
was imprisoned is a fit similitude of the christian formula. The
whole moral attitude of Christianity towards nature is represented in
his first vision. The beginning of his spiritual career is announced
by the evaporation of his animal nature in the form of vermin. The
christian hell is present, and these animal parts are burnt up. Among
those burnt-up powers of Swedenborg, one of the serpents must have been
his intellect. 'From that day forth I gave up all worldly learning.'

Here we have the ideal christian caught up to his paradise even while
his outward shape is visible. But what if we were all to become like
that? Suppose all the animal powers and desires were to evaporate out
of mankind and to be burnt up! Were that to occur to-day the effect
on the morrow would be but faintly told in that which would be caused
by sudden evaporations of steam from all the engines of the world. We
may imagine a band of philanthropists, sorely disturbed by the number
of accidents incidental to steam-locomotion, who should conspire
to go at daybreak to all the engine-houses and stations in England,
and, just as the engines were about to start for their work, should
quench their fires, let off their steam, and break their works. That
would be but a brief paralysis of the work of one country; but what
would be the result if the animal nature of man and its desires,
the works and trades that minister to the 'pomps and vanities,'
all worldly aims and joys, should be burnt up in fires of fanaticism!

Yet to that fatal aim Christianity gave itself,--so contrary to that
great heart in which was mirrored the beautiful world, its lilies
and little children, and where love shed its beams on the just
and the unjust! The organising principle of Christianity was that
which crucified Jesus and took his tomb for corner-stone of a system
modelled after what he hated. Its central purpose was to effect a
divorce between the moral and the animal nature of man. One is called
flesh and the other spirit; one was the child of God, the other the
child of the Devil. It rent asunder that which was really one; its
whole history, so long as it was in earnest, was the fanatical effort
to keep asunder by violence those two halves ever seeking harmony;
its history since its falsity was exposed has been the hypocrisy of
professing in word what is impossible in deed.



Beside the christian vision of Swedenborg, in which the judaic
priest's curse on swinish Greek learning found apotheosis, let us set
the vision of a Jewish seer in whom the humanity that spared Nineveh
found expression. The seer is Philo,--name rightly belonging to that
pure mind in which the starry ideals of his Semitic race embraced
the sensuous beauty which alone could give them life. Philo (Praem. et
Poenis, sec. 15-20) describes as the first joy of the redeemed earth
the termination of the war between man and animal. That war will end,
he says, 'when the wild beasts in the soul have been tamed. Then
the most ferocious animals will submit to man; scorpions will lose
their stings, and serpents their poison. And, in consequence of the
suppression of that older war between man and beast, the war between
man and man shall also end.'

Here we emerge from Swedenborg's brass column, we pass beyond Peter's
sword called 'Slay-and-eat,' we leave behind the Talmud's curse on
swine and learning: we rise to the clear vision of Hebrew prophecy
which beheld lion and lamb lying down together, a child leading the
wild forces subdued by culture.



'Why not God kill Debbil?' asked Man Friday. It is a question which
not even Psychology has answered, why no Theology has yet suggested
the death of the Devil in the past, or prophesied more than chains
for him in the future. No doubt the need of a 'hangman's whip to
haud the wretch in order' may partly account for it; but with this
may have combined a cause of which it is pleasanter to think--Devils
being animal passions in excess, even the ascetic recoils from their
destruction, with an instinct like that which restrains rats from
gnawing holes through the ship's bottom.



In Goethe's 'Faust' we read, Doch das Antike find' ich zu lebendig. It
is a criticism on the nudity of the Greek forms that appear in the
classical Walpurgis Night. But the authority is not good: it is
Mephistopheles who is disgusted with sight of the human form, and he
says they ought in modern fashion to be plastered over. His sentiments
have prevailed at the Vatican, where the antique statues and the great
pictures of Michael Angelo bear witness to the prurient prudery of the
papal mind. 'Devils are our sins in perspective,' says George Herbert.



Herodotus (ii. 47) says, 'The Egyptians consider the pig to be an
impure beast, and therefore if a man, in passing by a pig, should touch
him only with his garments, he forthwith goes to the river and plunges
in; and, in the next place, swineherds, although native Egyptians, are
the only men who are not allowed to enter any of their temples.' The
Egyptians, he says, do not sacrifice the goat; 'and, indeed, their
painters and sculptors represent Pan with the face and legs of a
goat, as the Grecians do; not that they imagine this to be his real
form, for they think him like other gods; but why they represent
him in this way I had rather not mention.' We need not feel the same
prudery. The Egyptians rightly regarded the symbol of sexual desire,
on whose healthy exercise the perpetuation of life depended, as a very
different kind of animalism from that symbolised in the pig's love of
refuse and garbage. Their association of the goat with Pan--the lusty
vigour of nature--was the natural preface to the arts of Greece in
which the wild forces were taught their first lesson--Temperance. Pan
becomes musical. The vigour and vitality of human nature find in the
full but not excessive proportions of Apollo, Aphrodite, Artemis,
and others of the bright array, the harmony which Pan with his pipe
preludes. The Greek statue is soul embodied and body ensouled.



Two men had I the happiness to know in my youth, into whose faces I
looked up and saw the throne of Genius illumined by Purity. One of
them, Ralph Waldo Emerson, wrote, 'If beauty, softness, and faith in
female forms have their own influence, vices even, in a slight degree,
are thought to improve the expression.' The other, Arthur Hugh Clough,
wrote, 'What we all love is good touched up with evil.' Here are two
brave flowers, of which one grew out of the thorny stem of Puritanism,
the other from the monastic root of Oxford. The 'vices' which could
improve the expression, even for the pure eyes of Emerson, are those
which represent the struggle of human nature to exist in truth,
albeit in misdirection and reaction, amid pious hypocrisies. The
Oxonian scholar had seen enough of the conventionalised characterless
'good' to long for some sign of life and freedom, even though it must
come as a touch of 'evil.' To the artist, nature is never seen in
petrifaction; it is really as well as literally a becoming. The evil
he sees is 'good in the making:' what others call vices are voices
in the wilderness preparing the way of the highest.



'God and the Devil make the whole of Religion,' said Nicoli--speaking,
perhaps, better than he knew. The culture of the world has shown
that the sometime opposed realms of human interest, so personified,
are equally essential. It is through this experience that the Devil
has gained such ample vindication from the poets--as in Rapisardi's
'Lucifero,' a veritable 'bringer of Light,' and Cranch's 'Satan.' From
the latter work ('Satan: A Libretto.' Boston: Roberts Brothers, 1874),
which should be more widely known, I quote some lines. Satan says--


                      I symbolise the wild and deep
        And unregenerated wastes of life,
        Dark with transmitted tendencies of race
        And blind mischance; all crude mistakes of will
        And tendency unbalanced by due weight
        Of favouring circumstance; all passion blown
        By wandering winds; all surplusage of force
        Piled up for use, but slipping from its base
        Of law and order.


This is the very realm in which the poet and the artist find their
pure-veined quarries, whence arise the forms transfigured in their
vision.



To evoke Helena, Faust, as we have seen, must repair to the
Mothers. But who may these be? They shine from Goethe's page in such
opalescent tints one cannot transfix their sense. They seemed to me
just now the primal conditions, by fulfilling which anything might be
attained, without which, nothing. But now (yet perhaps the difference
is not great) I see the Mothers to be the ancient healthy instincts
and ideals of our race. These took shape in forms of art, whose
evolution had been man's harmony with himself. Christianity, borrowing
thunder of one god, hammer of another, shattered them--shattered our
Mothers! And now learned travellers go about in many lands saying,
'Saw ye my beloved?' Amid cities ruined and buried we are trying to
recover them, fitting limb to limb--so carefully! as if half-conscious
that we are piecing together again the fragments of our own humanity.



'The Devil: Does he Exist, and what does he Do?' Such is the title of
a recent work by Father Delaporte, Professor of Dogma in the Faculty
of Bordeaux. He gives specific directions for exorcism of devils by
means of holy water, the sign of the cross, and other charms. 'These
measures,' says one of his American critics, 'may answer very well
against the French Devil; but our American Beelzebub is a potentate
that goeth not forth on any such hints.' Father Delaporte would
hardly contend that the use of cross and holy water for a thousand
years has been effectual in dislodging the European Beelzebub.

On the whole, I am inclined to prefer the method of the Africans of
the Guinea Coast. They believe in a particularly hideous devil, but
say that the only defence they require against him is a mirror. If any
one will keep a mirror beside him, the Devil must see himself in it,
and he at once rushes away in terror of his own ugliness.

No monster ever conjured up by imagination is more hideous than a
rational being transformed to a beast. Just that is every human being
who has brought his nobler powers down to be slaves of his animal
nature. No eye could look upon that fearful sight unmoved. All man
needs is a true mirror in which his own animalism may see itself. We
cannot borrow for this purpose the arts of Greece, nor the fairy
ideals of Germany, nor the emasculated saints of Christendom. These
were but fragments of the man who has been created by combination of
their powers, and their several ideals are broken bits that cannot
reflect the whole being of man in its proportions or disproportions.

The higher nature of man, polished by culture of all his faculties,
can alone be the faithful mirror before his lower. The clearness of
this mirror in the individual heart depends mainly on the civilisation
and knowledge surrounding it. The discovered law turns once plausible
theories to falsehoods; a noble literature transmutes once popular
books to trash. When Art interprets the realities of nature, when
it shows how much beauty and purity our human nature is capable of,
it holds a mirror before all deformities. At a theatre in the city of
London, I witnessed the performance of an actor who, in the course
of his part, struck a child. He was complimented by a hurricane of
hisses from the crowded gallery. Had those 'gods' up there never
struck children? Possibly. Yet here each had a mirror before him and
recoiled from his worst self. A clergyman relates that, while looking
at pictures in the Bethnal Green Museum, he overheard a poor woman,
who had been gazing on a Madonna, say, 'If I had such a child as
that I believe I could be a good woman.' Who can say what even that
one glance at her life in the ideal reflector may be worth to that
wanderer amid the miseries and temptations of London!



It is not easy for those who have seen what is high and holy to give
their hearts to what is base and unholy. It is as natural for human
nature to love virtue as to love any other beauty. External beauty
is visible to all, and all desire it: the interior beauty is not
visible to superficial glances, but the admiration shown even for its
counterfeits shows how natural it is to admire virtue. But in order
that the charm of this moral beauty may be felt by human nature it
must be related to that nature--real. It must not be some childish
ideal which answers to no need of the man of to-day; not something
imported from a time and place where it had meaning and force to
others where it has none.

When dogmas surviving from the primitive world are brought to behold
themselves in the mirror held up by Science, they cry out, 'That is not
my face! You are caricaturing my beliefs!' This recoil of Superstition
from its own ugliness is the victory of Religion. What priests bewail
as disbelief is faith fleeing from its deformities. Ignorant devotion
proves its need of Science by its terrors of the same, which are like
those of the horse at first sight of its best friend, bearer of its
burthens--the locomotive.



Religion, like every other high feature of human nature, has its animal
counterpart. The animalised religion is superstition. It has various
expressions,--the abjectness of one form, the ferocity of another,
the cunning of a third. It is unconscious of anything higher than
animalism. Its god is a very great animal preying on other animals,
which are laid on his altars; or pleased when smaller animals give
up their part of the earthly feast by starving their passions and
senses. Under the growth of civilisation and intelligence that pious
asceticism is revealed in its true form,--intensified animalism. The
asceticism of one age becomes the self-indulgence of another. The
two-footed animal having discovered that his god does not eat the
meat left for him, eats it himself. Learning that he gets as much
from his god by a wafer and a prayer, he offers these and retains
the gifts, treasures, and pleasures so commuted,--these, however,
being withdrawn from the direction of the higher nature by the fact
of being obtained through the conditions of the lower, and dependent
on their persistence. In process of time the forms and formulas of
religion, detached from all reality--such as no conceivable monarch
could desire--not only become senseless, but depend upon their
senselessness for continuance. They refuse to come at all within the
domain of reason or common-sense, and trust to mental torpor of the
masses, force of habit in the aggregate, self-interest in the wealthy
and powerful, bribes for thinkers and scholars.



Animalism disguised as a religion must render the human religion,
able to raise passions into divine attributes of a perfect manhood,
impossible so long as it continues. That a human religion can ever
come by any process of evolution from a superstition which can only
exist by ministry to the baser motives is a delusion. The only hope of
society is that its independent minds may gain culture, and so surround
this unextinct monster with mirrors that it may perish through shame
at its manifold deformities. These are symbolised in the many-headed
phantasm which is the subject of this work. Demon, Dragon, and Devil
have long paralysed the finest powers of man, peopling nature with
horrors, the heart with fears, and causing the religious sentiment
itself to make actual in history the worst excesses it professed to
combat in its imaginary adversaries. My largest hope is that from
the dragon-guarded well where Truth is too much concealed she may
emerge far enough to bring her mirror before these phantoms of fear,
and with far-darting beams send them back to their caves in Chaos
and ancient Night.



The battlements of the cloisters of Magdalen College, Oxford, are
crowned with an array of figures representing virtues and vices,
with carved allegories of teaching and learning. Under the Governor's
window are the pelican feeding its young from its breast, and the lion,
denoting the tenderness and the strength of a Master of youth. There
follow the professions--the lawyer embracing his client, the physician
with his bottle, the divine as Moses with his tables of the Law. Next
are the slayers of Goliath and other mythical enemies. We come to more
real, albeit monstrous, enemies; to Gluttony in ecclesiastical dress,
with tongue lolling out; and low-browed Luxury without any vesture,
with a wide-mouthed animal-eared face on its belly, the same tongue
lolling out--as in our figures of Typhon and Kali. Drunkenness has
three animal heads--one of a degraded humanity, another a sheep, the
third a goose. Cruelty is a werewolf; a frog-faced Lamia represents
its mixture with Lust; and other vices are represented by other
monsters, chiefly dragons with griffin forms, until the last is
reached--the Devil, who is just opposite the Governor's symbols across
the quadrangle.

So was represented, some centuries ago, the conflict of Ormuzd
and Ahriman, for the young soldiers who enlisted at Oxford for that
struggle. A certain amount of fancy has entered into the execution of
the figures; but, if this be carefully detached, the history which
I have attempted to tell in these volumes may be generally traced
in the Magdalen statues. Each represents some phase in the advance
of the world, when, under new emergencies, earlier symbols were
modified, recombined, and presently replaced by new shapes. It was
found inadequate to keep the scholar throwing stones at the mummy of
Goliath when by his side was living Gluttony in religious garb. The
scriptural symbols are gradually mixed with those of Greek and German
mythology, and by such contact with nature are able to generate forms,
whose lolling tongues, wide mouths, and other expressions, represent
with some realism the physiognomies of brutality let loose through
admission to human shape and power.

It may be that, when they were set up, the young Oxonian passed
shuddering these terrible forms, dreaded these werewolves and
succubae, and dreamed of going forth to impale dragons. But now the
sculptures excite only laughter or curiosity, when they are not
passed by without notice. Yet the old conflict between Light and
Darkness has not ceased. The ancient forms of it pass away; they
become grotesque. Such was necessarily the case where the excessive
mythological and fanciful elements introduced at one period fall upon
another period when they hide the meaning. Their obscurity, even for
antiquarians, marks how far away from those cold battlefields the
struggle they symbolised has passed. But it ceases not. Some scholars
who listen to the sweet vespers of Magdalen may think the conflict
over; if so, even poor brother Moody may enter the true kingdom before
them; for, when preaching in Baltimore last September, he said, 'Men
are possessed of devils just as much now as they ever were. The devil
of rum is as great as any that ever lived. Why cannot this one and
all others be cast out? Because there is sin in the christian camp.'



The picture which closes this volume has been made for me by the artist
Hennessey, to record an incident which occurred at the door of Notre
Dame in Paris last summer. I had been examining an ugly devil there
treading down human forms into hell; but a dear friend looked higher,
and saw a bird brooding over its young on a nest supported by that
same horrible head.

So, above the symbols of wrath in nature, Love still interweaves
heavenly tints with the mystery of life; beside the horns of pain
prepares melodies.

Even so, also, over the animalism which deforms man, rises the animal
perfection which shames that; here ascending above the reign of
violence by a feather's force, and securing to that little creature
a tenderness that could best express the heart of a Christ, when it
would gather humanity under his wings.

This same little scene at the cathedral door came before me again
as I saw the Oxonian youth, with their morning-faces, passing so
heedlessly those ancient sculptures at Magdalen. Over every happy
heart the same old love was brooding, in each nestling faculties
were trying to gain their wings. To what will they aspire, those
students moving so light-hearted amid the dead dragons and satans
of an extinct world? Do they think there are no more dragons to be
slain? Know they that saying, 'He descended into hell;' and that,
from Orpheus and Herakles to Mohammed and Swedenborg, this is the
burthen felt by those who would be saviours of men?

It is not only loving birds that build their nests and rear their young
over the horns of forgotten fears, but, alas! the Harpies too! These,
which Dante saw nestling in still plants--once men who had wronged
themselves--rear successors above the aspirations that have ended in
'nothing but leaves.' The sculptures of Magdalen are incomplete. There
is a vacant side to the quadrangle, which, it is to be feared, awaits
the truer teaching that would fill it up with the real dragons which
no youth could heedlessly pass. Who can carve there the wrongs that
await their powers of redress? Who can set before them, with all
its baseness, the true emblem of pious fraud? When will they see in
any stone mirror the real shape of a double-tongued Culture--one fork
intoning litanies, another whispering contempt of them? The werewolves
of scholarly selfishness, the Lamias of christian casuistry, the subtle
intelligence that is fed by sages and heroes, but turns them to dust,
nay, to venom, because it dares not be human, still crawls--these
are yet to be revealed in all their horrors. Then will the old cry,
Sursum Corda, sound over the ancient symbols whereon scholars waste
their strength, by which they are conquered; and wings of courage shall
bear them with their arrows of light to rescue from Superstition the
holy places of Humanity.
